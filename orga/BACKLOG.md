## query normalization and optimization

Create a package that normalizes and optimizes mango queries.

- optimization: Use $eq instead of $in if $in value has only one item
- optimization: if field is an enum use $in instead of other operators with $in: [all enum values that match the operators]
- optimization: query always returns empty-array if $eq does not match schema
- optimization: detect can-never-match queries (p.e. impossible $eq values or empty $in array)
- optimization: merge $and operators
- Use index for $regex query if possible https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/regex/#index-use
- If $eq on primaryKey and has other operators, use a find-by-id and the filter the results on the query operators.
