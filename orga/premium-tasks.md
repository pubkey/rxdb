# Premium Tasks

If you are a **single developer** and you use RxDB in your **side project**, you can get free 2 years access to the [RxDB Premium](https://rxdb.info/premium) package by solving one Task of this list. Before you start working on that task, please make an issue where you tell about the estimated time to finish the task.


## Open Tasks

- Fix the flaky tests for the "example-supabase" CI task. This randomly fails, it should be fixed either by analyzing+fixing the current problem or updating to the newest supabase version.

- Add a [local search](https://github.com/cmfcmf/docusaurus-search-local) plugin to the docusaurus docs. The search-bar must only appear on the documentation pages, not on the landingpage.

(This list will be regularly updated with new Tasks)
