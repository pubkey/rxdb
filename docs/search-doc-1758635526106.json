Firebase has many features and products, two of which are client side databases. The Realtime Database and the Cloud Firestore.  Firebase - Realtime Database​  The firebase realtime database was the first database in firestore. It has to be mentioned that in this context, &quot;realtime&quot; means &quot;realtime replication&quot;, not &quot;realtime computing&quot;. The firebase realtime database stores data as a big unstructured JSON tree that is replicated between clients and the backend.  Firebase - Cloud Firestore​  The firestore is the successor to the realtime database. The big difference is that it behaves more like a 'normal' database that stores data as documents inside of collections. The conflict resolution strategy of firestore is always last-write-wins which might or might not be suitable for your use case.  The biggest difference to RxDB is that firebase products are only able to be used on top of the Firebase cloud hosted backend, which creates a vendor lock-in. RxDB can replicate with any self hosted CouchDB server or custom GraphQL endpoints. You can even replicate Firestore to RxDB with the Firestore Replication Plugin.

The main difference to other projects is the complex project configuration via the amplify cli and the bit confusing query syntax that works over functions. Complex Queries with multiple OR/AND statements are not possible which might change in the future. Local development is hard because the AWS AppSync mock does not support realtime replication. It also is not really offline-first because a user login is always required.  // An AWS datastore OR query const posts = await DataStore.query(Post, c =&gt; c.or( c =&gt; c.rating(&quot;gt&quot;, 4).status(&quot;eq&quot;, PostStatus.PUBLISHED) )); // An AWS datastore SORT query const posts = await DataStore.query(Post, Predicates.ALL, { sort: s =&gt; s.rating(SortDirection.ASCENDING).title(SortDirection.DESCENDING) });   The biggest difference to RxDB is that you have to use the AWS cloud backends.

The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint. Because of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets. RxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0 so it now allows to use different RxStorage implementations.

You can still persist to a permanent storage (IndexedDB, Filesystem etc.) with one of the provided storage adapters. The persistence happens after a timeout is reached after a write, or before the JavaScript process exits. This also means you could loose data when the JavaScript process exits ungracefully like when the power of the device is shut down or the browser crashes. While the project is not that active anymore, it is more finished than unmaintained.  In the past, RxDB supported using LokiJS as RxStorage but because the LokiJS is not maintained anymore and had too many issues, this storage option was removed in RxDB version 16.

Instead it runs on so called mutators that unify behavior on the client and server side. So instead of implementing and calling REST routes on both sides of your stack, you will implement mutators that define a specific delta behavior based on the input data. To observe data in replicache, there are subscriptions that notify your frontend application about changes to the state. Replicache can be used in most frontend technologies like browsers, React/Remix, NextJS/Vercel and React Native. While Replicache can be installed and used from npm, the Replicache source code is not open source and the Replicache github repo does not allow you to inspect or debug it.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"How RxDB can run in Flutter​","type":1,"pageTitle":"RxDB as a Database in a Flutter Application","url":"/articles/flutter-database.html#how-rxdb-can-run-in-flutter","content":" RxDB is written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript. To run it in a Flutter application, the flutter_qjs library is used to spawn a QuickJS JavaScript runtime. RxDB itself runs in that runtime and communicates with the flutter dart runtime. To store data persistent, the LokiJS RxStorage is used together with a custom storage adapter that persists the database inside of the shared_preferences data.  To use RxDB, you have to create a compatible JavaScript file that creates your RxDatabase and starts some connectors which are used by Flutter to communicate with the JavaScript RxDB database via setFlutterRxDatabaseConnector().  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs'; import { setFlutterRxDatabaseConnector, getLokijsAdapterFlutter } from 'rxdb/plugins/flutter'; // do all database creation stuff in this method. async function createDB(databaseName) { // create the RxDatabase const db = await createRxDatabase({ // the database.name is variable so we can change it on the flutter side name: databaseName, storage: getRxStorageLoki({ adapter: getLokijsAdapterFlutter() }), multiInstance: false }); await db.addCollections({ heroes: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'id', type: 'object', properties: { id: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, name: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, color: { type: 'string', maxLength: 30 } }, indexes: ['name'], required: ['id', 'name', 'color'] } } }); return db; } // start the connector so that flutter can communicate with the JavaScript process setFlutterRxDatabaseConnector( createDB );   Before you can use the JavaScript code, you have to bundle it into a single .js file. In this example we do that with webpack in a npm script here which bundles everything into the javascript/dist/index.js file.  To allow Flutter to access that file during runtime, add it to the assets inside of your pubspec.yaml:  flutter: assets: - javascript/dist/index.js   Also you need to install RxDB in your flutter part of the application. First you have to use the rxdb dart package as a flutter dependency. Currently the package is not published at the dart pub.dev. Instead you have to install it from the local filesystem inside of your RxDB npm installation.  # inside of pubspec.yaml dependencies: rxdb: path: path/to/your/node_modules/rxdb/src/plugins/flutter/dart   Afterwards you can import the rxdb library in your dart code and connect to the JavaScript process from there. For reference, check out the lib/main.dart file.  import 'package:rxdb/rxdb.dart'; // start the javascript process and connect to the database RxDatabase database = await getRxDatabase(&quot;javascript/dist/index.js&quot;, databaseName); // get a collection RxCollection collection = database.getCollection('heroes'); // insert a document RxDocument document = await collection.insert({ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;zflutter-${DateTime.now()}&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: nameController.text, &quot;color&quot;: colorController.text }); // create a query RxQuery&lt;RxHeroDocType&gt; query = RxDatabaseState.collection.find(); // create list to store query results List&lt;RxDocument&lt;RxHeroDocType&gt;&gt; documents = []; // subscribe to a query query.$().listen((results) { setState(() { documents = results; }); });   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Different RxStorage layers for RxDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"RxDB as a Database in a Flutter Application","url":"/articles/flutter-database.html#different-rxstorage-layers-for-rxdb","content":" RxDB offers multiple storage options, known as RxStorage layers, to store data locally.

This is accomplished through quota management policies, which can vary among Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others. Some browsers use a percentage of your total disk space, while others rely on a fixed maximum or dynamic approach per origin. These policies are designed to prevent malicious or poorly optimized web pages from consuming an unreasonable amount of user storage.  Chrome (and Chromium-based browsers) typically allow you to use a percentage of the user’s free disk space, whereas Firefox historically prompts users to allow more than 5 MB in mobile or 50 MB in desktop. Safari often sets tighter maximum caps, especially on iOS devices. Edge aligns closely with Chrome’s rules but can also include enterprise or corporate policy overrides.

Firefox\t~2 GB (desktop) or ~5 MB initial for mobile\tOlder versions asked permission at 50 MB for desktop. Ephemeral/incognito sessions may require repeated user prompts. Safari (iOS)\t~1 GB per origin (variable)\tHistorically stricter. iOS devices limit quotas further. Behavior can differ between iOS Safari versions or iPadOS. Edge\tSimilar to Chrome’s 80% of free space\tCan be influenced by Windows enterprise policies.

Often, the request to IndexedDB simply fails with an error event. Handling this gracefully is essential to avoid crashes or data corruption.  A typical approach is to wrap your write operations in try/catch blocks or in onsuccess / onerror event callbacks. If you detect a quota error, you can prompt the user to clear out old items or reduce the scope of offline data. Some apps implement a fallback system that removes less critical documents to free space and then retries the write.  try { const tx = db.transaction('largeStore', 'readwrite'); const store = tx.objectStore('largeStore'); await store.add(hugeData, someKey); await tx.done; } catch (error) { if (error.name === 'QuotaExceededError') { console.warn('IndexedDB quota exceeded.

There are a few advanced tactics you can use:  If you store binary data such as images or videos, consider compressing them via the Compression Streams API. For textual or JSON data, a library like RxDB supports built-in key-compression to shorten field names or entire documents. This can be extremely helpful when storing large sets of objects:  // Example: How key-compression can transform your documents internally const uncompressed = { &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Corrine&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Ziemann&quot;, &quot;shoppingCartItems&quot;: [ { &quot;productNumber&quot;: 29857, &quot;amount&quot;: 1 }, { &quot;productNumber&quot;: 53409, &quot;amount&quot;: 6 } ] }; const compressed = { &quot;|e&quot;: &quot;Corrine&quot;, &quot;|g&quot;: &quot;Ziemann&quot;, &quot;|i&quot;: [ { &quot;|h&quot;: 29857, &quot;|b&quot;: 1 }, { &quot;|h&quot;: 53409, &quot;|b&quot;: 6 } ] };   Sharding data across multiple subdomains or iframes is another trick, though it complicates communication. When you need truly massive offline data, you might store part of the data under sub1.yoursite.com and another chunk under sub2.yoursite.com, using postMessage() to coordinate. This can circumvent single-origin limitations, but it introduces extra complexity. Another effective method is to let data expire automatically—perhaps older records are removed if they haven’t been accessed for a certain period.

Relational databases are still a top choice for many enterprise back-ends, especially when advanced analytics or strongly enforced referential integrity is needed.

However, certain scenarios may benefit more from a SQL solution:  Complex Relationships: If your data demands intricate joins across multiple entities (e.g., many-to-many relationships that can’t easily be embedded in a single document), a well-structured relational schema can simplify queries.Strong Integrity and Constraints: SQL excels at enforcing constraints such as foreign keys, unique constraints, and advanced triggers. If your system needs strict data validation and complex business logic within the database, SQL might prove more robust.High-End Analytical Queries: Relational databases can handle sophisticated aggregations, groupings, and joins more efficiently. If your app frequently runs advanced SQL queries, a NoSQL approach may complicate or slow down analytics.Legacy Integration: Many enterprise systems are built around existing relational schemas. A purely NoSQL approach might mean rewriting or bridging systems that are heavily reliant on SQL constraints and transformations.Transaction Handling: While many NoSQL solutions have improved transaction support, it can still lag behind well-established SQL transaction models. If ACID properties and multi-operation atomicity are paramount, you might prefer a tried-and-true relational engine.  In short, if you prioritize advanced relational queries, robust constraints, or complex business rules at the database level, SQL remains a powerful, and possibly superior, choice.

PostgreSQL offers the JSON and JSONB types, enabling developers to store raw JSON in a column.

This approach, while seemingly simple, usually does not scale. Key issues include:  No Concurrency: If multiple parts of the application try to write to the same JSON file, you risk overwriting changes.No Indexes: Finding or filtering items in large JSON text requires scanning everything. This is slow and quickly becomes unmanageable.No Partial Updates: You often reload the entire file, modify it in memory, then write it back, which is highly inefficient for large data sets.Corruption Risk: A single corrupted write or partial save might break the entire JSON file, losing all data.High Memory Usage: The entire file may need to be parsed into memory, even if you only need a fraction of the data.

Cookies store small pieces of key-value data that are mainly used for session management, personalization, and tracking. Cookies can have several security settings like a time-to-live or the domain attribute to share the cookies between several subdomains.  Cookies values are not only stored at the client but also sent with every http request to the server. This means we cannot store much data in a cookie but it is still interesting how good cookie access performance compared to the other methods. Especially because cookies are such an important base feature of the web, many performance optimizations have been done and even these days there is still progress being made like the Shared Memory Versioning by chromium or the asynchronous CookieStore API.

LocalStorage provides a simple API to store key-value pairs inside of a web browser. It has the methods setItem, getItem, removeItem and clear which is all you need from a key-value store. LocalStorage is only suitable for storing small amounts of data that need to persist across sessions and it is limited by a 5MB storage cap. Storing complex data is only possible by transforming it into a string for example with JSON.stringify(). The API is not asynchronous which means if fully blocks your JavaScript process while doing stuff. Therefore running heavy operations on it might block your UI from rendering.  There is also the SessionStorage API. The key difference is that localStorage data persists indefinitely until explicitly cleared, while sessionStorage data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.

IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing large amounts of structured JSON data. While the API is a bit hard to use, IndexedDB can utilize indexes and asynchronous operations. It lacks support for complex queries and only allows to iterate over the indexes which makes it more like a base layer for other libraries then a fully fledged database.  In 2018, IndexedDB version 2.0 was introduced. This added some major improvements. Most noticeable the getAll() method which improves performance dramatically when fetching bulks of JSON documents.

It is designed for data-intensive applications that want to write and read binary data in a simulated file system.  OPFS can be used in two modes:  Either asynchronous on the main threadOr in a WebWorker with the faster, asynchronous access with the createSyncAccessHandle() method.  Because only binary data can be processed, OPFS is made to be a base filesystem for library developers. You will unlikely directly want to use the OPFS in your code when you build a &quot;normal&quot; application because it is too complex.

WASM code can be shipped to browser apps and generally runs much faster compared to JavaScript, but still about 10% slower then native.  Many people started to use compiled SQLite as a database inside of the browser which is why it makes sense to also compare this setup to the native APIs.  The compiled byte code of SQLite has a size of about 938.9 kB which must be downloaded and parsed by the users on the first page load. WASM cannot directly access any persistent storage API in the browser. Instead it requires data to flow from WASM to the main-thread and then can be put into one of the browser APIs.

If your users' muscle memory puts the left hand on the F5 key while using your website, you did something wrong!  Not all storage APIs support a way to automatically share write events between tabs.  Only localstorage has a way to automatically share write events between tabs by the API itself with the storage-event which can be used to observe changes.  // localStorage can observe changes with the storage event. // This feature is missing in IndexedDB and others addEventListener(&quot;storage&quot;, (event) =&gt; {});   There was the experimental IndexedDB observers API for chrome, but the proposal repository has been archived.  To workaround this problem, there are two solutions:  The first option is to use the BroadcastChannel API which can send messages across browser tabs. So whenever you do a write to the storage, you also send a notification to other tabs to inform them about these changes. This is the most common workaround which is also used by RxDB. Notice that there is also the WebLocks API which can be used to have mutexes across browser tabs.The other solution is to use the SharedWorker and do all writes inside of the worker. All browser tabs can then subscribe to messages from that single SharedWorker and know about changes.

In IndexedDB for example, we can fetch a bulk of documents by a given index range:  // find all products with a price between 10 and 50 const keyRange = IDBKeyRange.bound(10, 50); const transaction = db.transaction('products', 'readonly'); const objectStore = transaction.objectStore('products'); const index = objectStore.index('priceIndex'); const request = index.getAll(keyRange); const result = await new Promise((res, rej) =&gt; { request.onsuccess = (event) =&gt; res(event.target.result); request.onerror = (event) =&gt; rej(event); });   Notice that IndexedDB has the limitation of not having indexes on boolean values.

This ensures that our app keeps being responsive and fast while the processing can run in parallel in the background. In a browser you can either use the WebWorker, SharedWorker or the ServiceWorker API to do that. In RxDB you can use the WebWorker or SharedWorker plugins to move your storage inside of a worker.  The most common API for that use case is spawning a WebWorker and doing most work on that second JavaScript process. The worker is spawned from a separate JavaScript file (or base64 string) and communicates with the main thread by sending data with postMessage().  Unfortunately LocalStorage and Cookiescannot be used in WebWorker or SharedWorker because of the design and security constraints. WebWorkers run in a separate global context from the main browser thread and therefore cannot do stuff that might impact the main thread. They have no direct access to certain web APIs, like the DOM, localStorage, or cookies.  Everything else can be used from inside a WebWorker. The fast version of OPFS with the createSyncAccessHandle method can onlybe used in a WebWorker, and not on the main thread.

Because the stored cookies are send to the server with every HTTP request, this limitation is reasonable. You can test your browsers cookie limits here.

Once you have reached that point you can not even serve updated JavaScript to your user to clean up the cookies and you will have locked out that user until the cookies get cleaned up manually.

This approach is increasingly popular because it leads to instant app responses (no network delay for most operations), genuine offline capability, and more direct data ownership for users. Local-first apps also sidestep outages and if the server or internet goes down, users can keep working with their local data. When connectivity returns, everything syncs. This makes the user experience more resilient and gives them control of their data, which is especially appealing when privacy concerns or limited connectivity are key factors.

Early web storage options like cookies or localStorage had tiny limits (~5-10MB) and were unsuitable for complex data. Even IndexedDB, the structured client storage introduced over a decade ago, had restrictive quotas on many browsers: For example, older Firefox versions would prompt the user if more than 50MB was being stored. Mobile browsers often capped IndexedDB to 5MB without user permission. Such limits made it impractical to cache large application datasets on the client. However, modern browsers have dramatically increased these limits. Today, IndexedDB can typically store hundreds of megabytes to multiple gigabytes of data, depending on device capacity. Chrome allows up to ~80% of free disk space per origin (tens of GB on a desktop), Firefox now supports on the order of gigabytes per site (10% of disk size), and even Safari (historically strict) permits around 1GB per origin on iOS. In short, the storage quotas of 5-50MB are a thing of the past and modern web apps can cache very large datasets locally without hitting a ceiling. This shift in storage capabilities has unlocked new possibilities for local-first web apps that simply weren't viable a few years ago. New Storage APIs (OPFS): The new Browser API Origin Private File System (OPFS), part of the File System Access API, enables near-native file I/O from within a browser. It allows web apps to manage file handles securely and perform fast, synchronous reads/writes in Web Workers. This is a huge deal for local-first computing because it makes it feasible to embed robust database engines directly in the browser, persisting data to real files on a virtual filesystem. With OPFS, you can avoid some of the performance overhead that comes with IndexedDB-based workarounds, providing a near-native speed experience for file-structured data.  Bandwidth Has Grown, But Latency Is Capped: Internet infrastructure has rapidly expanded to provide higher throughput making it possible to transfer large amounts of data more quickly. However, latency (i.e., round-trip delay) is constrained by the speed of light and other physical limitations in fiber, satellite links, and routing. We can always build out bigger &quot;pipes&quot; to stream or send bulk data, but we can't significantly reduce the base round-trip time for each request. This is a physical limit, not a technological one. Local-first strategies mitigate this fundamental latency limit by avoiding excessive client-server calls in interactive workflows, once data is on the client, it's instantly available for reads and writes without waiting on a network round-trip. Imagine, transferring around 100,000 &quot;average&quot; JSON documents might only consume about the same bandwidth as two frames of a 4K YouTube video which can be transferred in milliseconds. This shows just how far raw data throughput has come. Yet each request still has a 100-200ms latency or more, which becomes noticeable in user interactions. Local-first mitigates this by minimizing round-trip calls during active use and using the available bandwidth to directly transfer most of the data on the first app start.  WebAssembly: Another advancement is WebAssembly (WASM), which allows developers to compile low-level languages (C, C++, Rust) for execution in the browser at near-native speed. This means database engines, search algorithms, vector databases, and other performance-heavy tasks can run right on the client. However, a key limitation is that WASM cannot directly access persistent storage APIs in the browser. Instead, all data must be send from WASM to JavaScript (or the main thread) and then go through something like IndexedDB or OPFS. This extra indirection is slower compared to plain JavaScript-&gt;storage calls. Looking ahead, there might come up future APIs that allow WASM to interface with persistent storage directly, and if those land, local-first systems could see another major boost in performance. Improvements in Local-First Tooling: A major factor fueling the rise of local-first architectures is the dramatic leap in client-side tooling and performance. For instance, consider a local-first email client that stores one million messages. In 2014, searching through that many documents, especially with something like early PouchDB, could take minutes in a browser. Today, with advanced offline databases like RxDB, you can use the OPFS storage with sharding across multiple web workers (one per CPU) and use memory-mapped techniques. The result is a regex search of one million of these email documents in around 120 milliseconds - all in JavaScript, running inside a standard web browser, on a mobile phone. Better yet, this performance ceiling is likely to keep rising. Newer browser features and WebAssembly optimizations could enable even faster indexing and query operations, closing the gap with native desktop clients. I even experimented with GPU-accelarated queries (using WebGPU) which, while still in experimental stage, might deliver client-side performance that outperforms servers which do not have a graphics card. These transformations highlight why local-first has become truly practical: not only can you sync and work offline, but you can handle serious data loads with performance that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.

There's no round-trip delay for most operations. Local-first apps aim to provide near-zero latency responses by querying a local database instead of waiting for a server response​. This results in a snappy UX (often no need for loading spinners) because data reads/writes happen immediately on-device. Modern users expect real-time feedback, and local-first delivers that by default.  User Control &amp; Privacy: Storing data locally can limit how much sensitive information is sent off to remote servers. End users have greater control over their data, and the app can implement client-side encryption, thereby reducing the risk of mass data breaches. Its even possible to only replicated encrypted data with a server so that the backend does not know about the data at all and just acts as a backup/replication endpoint.  Offline Resilience: Obviously, being able to work offline is a major benefit. Users can continue using the app with no internet (or flaky connectivity), and their changes sync up once online. This is increasingly important not just for remote areas, but for any app that needs to be available 24/7. Even though mobile networks have improved, connectivity can still drop; local-first ensures the app doesn't grind to a halt. The app &quot;stores data locally at the client so that it can still access it when the internet goes away.&quot;  Realtime Apps: Today's users expect data to stay in sync across browser tabs and devices without constant page reloads. In a typical cloud app, if you want real-time updates (say to show that a friend edited a document), you'd need to implement a websocket or polling system for the server to push changes to clients, which is complex. Local-first architectures naturally lend themselves to realtime-by-default updates because the application state lives in a local database that can be observed for changes. Any edits (local or incoming from the server) immediately trigger UI updates. Similarly, background sync mechanisms ensure that new server-side data flows into the local store and into the user interface right away, no need to hit F5 to fetch the latest changes like on a traditional webpage.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Developer Experience Benefits​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Local-First Software Is the Future and what are its Limitations","url":"/articles/local-first-future.html#developer-experience-benefits","content":" Reduced Server Load: Because local-first architectures typically transfer large chunks of data once (e.g., during an initial sync) and then sync only small diffs (delta changes) afterward, the server does not have to handle repeated requests for the same dataset. This bulk-first, diff-later approach drastically decreases the total number of round-trip requests to the backend. In scenarios where hundreds of simultaneous users each require continuous data access, an offline-ready client that only periodically sends or receives changes can scale more efficiently, freeing your servers to handle more users or other tasks. Instead of being bombarded with frequent small queries and updates, the server focuses on periodic sync operations, which can be more easily optimized or batched. It Scales with Data, Not Load. In fact for most type of apps, most of the data itself rarely changes. Imagine a CRM system, how often does the data of a customer really change compared to how of a user open the customer-overview page which would load data from a server in traditional systems? Less Need for Custom API Endpoints: A local-first architecture often simplifies backend design. Instead of writing extensive REST routes for each client operation (create, read, update, delete, etc.), you can build a single replication endpoint or a small set of endpoints to handle data synchronization for each entity. The client manages local data, merges edits, and pushes/pulls changes with the server automatically. This not only reduces boilerplate code on the backend but also frees developers to focus on business logic and domain-specific concerns rather than spending time creating and maintaining dozens of narrowly scoped endpoints. As a result, the overall system can be easier to scale and maintain, delivering a smoother developer experience. Simplified State Management in Frontend: Because the local database holds the authoritative state, you might rely less on complex state management libraries (Redux, MobX, etc.). The DB becomes a single source of truth for your UI. In an offline-first app, your global state is already there in a single place stored inside of the local database, so you don't need as many in-memory state layers to synchronize​. The UI can directly bind to the database (using queries or reactive subscriptions). All sources of changes (user input, remote updates, other tabs) funnel through the database. This can significantly reduce the &quot;glue code&quot; to keep UI state in sync with server state because the local DB does that for you. With Local-First tools, &quot;you might not need Redux&quot; because the reactive DB fulfills that role​ of state management already. Observable Queries: One of the big advantages of storing data locally is the ability to subscribe to data changes in real time, often called observable queries. When the data changes - either from the user's actions or from a remote sync - the local database automatically updates the subscribed query results, and the UI can redraw without a manual refresh. This reactive pattern can make apps feel much more live and responsive. In the beginnings this was mostly done by watching a changes feed (like in PouchDB) and re-running queries whenever data changed. However, this early approach was slow and didn't scale well, because the entire query had to be recalculated each time. Later, RxDB introduced the EventReduce Algorithm, which merges incoming document changes into an existing query result by using a big binary decision tree. With this, updated query results can be &quot;calculated&quot; on the CPU instead of re-running them over the database. This makes query updates almost instantaneous and scales better as your data grows. Nowadays, many local databases have added similar features: for example, dexie.js introduced liveQuery, letting developers build real-time UIs without repeatedly scanning the entire dataset. Better Multi-Tab and Multi-Device Consistency: Because the source of truth is on the client, if the user has the app open in multiple tabs or even multiple devices, each has a full copy of the data. In browsers, many offline databases use a storage like IndexedDB that is shared across tabs of the same origin. This means all tabs see the same up-to-date local state. For example, if a user logs in or adds data in one tab, the other tab can automatically reflect that change via the shared local DB and events​. This solves a common issue in web apps where one tab doesn't know that something changed in another tab. With local-first, multi-tab just works by default because there's &quot;exactly one state of the data across all tabs&quot;. Similarly, on multiple devices, once sync runs, each device eventually converges to the same state. If your users have to press F5 all the time, your app is broken! Potential for P2P and Decentralization: While most current local-first apps still use a central backend for syncing, the paradigm opens the door to peer-to-peer data syncing. Because each device has the full data, devices could sync directly via LAN or other P2P channels for collaboration, reducing reliance on central servers. There are experimental frameworks that allow truly decentralized sync. This is a more advanced benefit, but it aligns with the ethos of giving users more control and reducing dependence on any one cloud provider.  These advantages show why developers are excited about local-first. You get happier users thanks to a fast, offline-capable app, and you can differentiate your product by working in scenarios where others fail (e.g. poor connectivity). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., invest heavily in reducing latency and adding offline modes for a reason: it improves retention and usability. Local-first design takes that to the extreme by default.

It's important to understand the drawbacks and trade-offs before deciding to go all-in on local-first. Let's examine the flip side.  You fully understood a technology when you know when not to use it.  Critics of local-first approaches often point out these challenges. Here's a comprehensive list of cons, criticisms, and obstacles associated with local-first development and proposed solutions on how to solve these obstacles:  Data Synchronization: Data synchronization is arguably the hardest part of local-first development, because when every user's device can be offline for extended periods, data inevitably diverges. Ensuring those changes propagate and reconcile with minimal user headaches is a major challenge in distributed systems. Two main approaches have emerged: Use a bundled frontend+backend solution where the backend is tightly coupled to the client SDK and knows exactly how to handle sync. A common example is Firestore (part of the Firebase ecosystem) where Google's servers and client libraries collectively manage storage, change detection, conflict resolution, and syncing. The upside is you have a turnkey solution, developers can focus on features rather than writing sync logic. The downside is lock-in, because the sync protocol is proprietary and tailored to that vendor. In many organizations, this is a non-starter: existing company infrastructure can't be uprooted or replaced just for a single offline-capable app. This lock-in issue can arise even if the backend is not strictly a third-party vendor but simply another technology like PostgreSQL, because it still forces you to consolidate all your data into a single system that you might not use otherwise. Custom Replication with Your Own Endpoints: Alternatively, tools like RxDB allow you to implement your own replication endpoints on top of your existing infrastructure. This is the approach relies on a lightweight, git-like Sync Engine. The server remains relatively &quot;dumb,&quot; focusing on storing revisions, tracking changes, and marking conflicts, while the client library does the actual conflict resolution. During sync, if the server detects a conflict (e.g., two offline edits to the same document), it notifies the client, which then decides how to merge them, whether via last-write-wins, a custom merge function, or a CRDT. Setting up custom endpoints does require more development effort, but you avoid vendor lock-in and can integrate seamlessly with your existing database(s). Your system simply needs to support incrementally fetching changes (pull) and accepting local modifications (push), which can be layered on top of nearly any data store or architecture. Tools which support &quot;any backend&quot; are of course harder to monetize because they cannot sell SaaS services or a Cloud Subscription which is why most tools use a fixed backend instead of an open Sync Engine.  Conflict Resolution: When multiple offline edits happen on the same data, you inevitably get merge conflicts. For example, if two users (or the same user on two devices) both edit the same document offline, when both sync, whose changes win? Local-first systems need a conflict resolution strategy. Some systems use last-write-wins (firestore) or deterministic revision hashing to pick a &quot;winner&quot; (as in CouchDB/PouchDB)​. This is simple but may drop one user's changes. Other approaches keep both versions and merge them either via an implement &quot;merge-function&quot; or require a manual merge step (e.g., like git conflicts or showing the user a diff UI). More advanced solutions involve CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) which mathematically merge changes (used for rich text collaboration, for instance). Libraries like Automerge or Yjs implement CRDTs to &quot;magically solve conflicts&quot;. But in practice, using CRDTs is also complex and has its own trade-offs and sometimes not even possible like when you need additional data from another instance for a &quot;correct&quot; merge. No matter which route, handling conflicts adds complexity to your app logic or infrastructure. In cloud-based (online-first) apps, you avoid this because everyone is always editing the single up-to-date copy on the server. Local-first shifts that burden to the client side. Here is an example on how a client-side merge functions works in RxDB: import { deepEqual } from 'rxdb/plugins/utils'; export const myConflictHandler = { /** * isEqual() is used to detect if two documents are * equal. This is used internally to detect conflicts. */ isEqual(a, b) { /** * isEqual() is used to detect conflicts or to detect if a * document has to be pushed to the remote. * If the documents are deep equal, * we have no conflict. * Because deepEqual is CPU expensive, * on your custom conflict handler you might only * check some properties, like the updatedAt time or revision-strings * for better performance. */ return deepEqual(a, b); }, /** * resolve() a conflict. This can be async so * you could even show an UI element to let your user * resolve the conflict manually. */ async resolve(i) { /** * In this example we drop the local state and use the server-state. * This basically implements a &quot;first-on-server-wins&quot; strategy. * * In your custom conflict handler you could want to merge properties * of the i.realMasterState, i.assumedMasterState and i.newDocumentState * or return i.newDocumentState to have a &quot;last-write-wins&quot; strategy. */ return i.realMasterState; } };   Eventual Consistency (No Single Source of Truth): A local-first system is eventually consistent by nature. There is no single authoritative copy of the data at all times. Instead you have one per device (and maybe one on the server), and they sync to become consistent eventually. This means at any given moment, two users might not see the same data if one hasn't synced recently. Users could even make decisions based on stale data. In many applications this is acceptable (the data will catch up), but for some scenarios it's problematic. For instance, an offline-first banking app that lets you initiate a money transfer offline could be dangerous if the account balance was out-of-date or if the transfer needs immediate consistency. Essentially, not all apps can tolerate eventual consistency. If your use case demands strong consistency (e.g., inventory systems where overselling is a big issue, or real-time collaborative editing where every keystroke must be seen by others instantly), a purely local-first approach might need augmentation or may not fit. Initial Data Load and Data Size Limits: Local-first requires pulling data down to the client. If your dataset is huge (gigabytes), it's simply not feasible to download everything to every client. For example, syncing every tweet on Twitter to every user's phone is impossible. Local-first works best when the data set per user is reasonably sized (up to 2 Gigabytes). In practice, you often limit the data to just that user's own data or a subset relevant to them. Even then, on first use the app might need to download a significant chunk of data to initialize the local database. There is a upper bound on dataset size beyond which the initial sync or storage needs become impractical. You cannot assume unlimited local storage. If your data is too large, local-first will either fail or you'll need to only sync partial data (and then handle what happens if the needed data isn't present locally). In short, local-first is unsuitable for massive datasets or data that cannot be partitioned per user.  Storage Persistence (Browser Limitations): Storing data in the browser (via IndexedDB or similar) is not as durable as on a server disk. Browsers may evict data to save space (especially on mobile devices). For instance, Safari notoriously wipes out IndexedDB data if the user hasn't used the site in ~7 days. Other browsers have their own eviction policies for offline data. Also, users can at any time clear their browser storage (intentionally or via something like &quot;Clear site data&quot;). This means the local data cannot be 100% trusted to stay forever. A well-behaved local-first app needs to be able to recover if local data is lost, usually by pulling from the server again​. Essentially, the server still often serves as a backup. But if your app had any purely local data (not intended to sync), that's at risk. Mobile apps (with SQLite or filesystem storage) are a bit more stable than web browsers, but even there, uninstalls or certain OS actions can remove local data. This is a challenge: How to cache data offline for speed while ensuring if it's wiped, the user doesn't lose everything important. Cloud-only apps by contrast keep data in the cloud so it's typically safe unless the server fails (and servers are easier to backup reliably).  Complex Client-Side Logic &amp; Increased App Size: A local-first app tends to be more complex on the client side. You're essentially putting what used to be server responsibilities (storage, query engine, sync logic) into the frontend. This can increase the size of your frontend bundle (including a database library, possibly CRDT or sync code, etc.). It also increases memory and CPU usage on the client, as the browser/phone is doing more work. Low-end devices or older phones might struggle if the app is not optimized. Developers need to consider performance tuning for the local database (indexing, query efficiency) just like they would on a server. So while the user gains benefits, the app developer has to manage this complexity. Performance Constraints in JavaScript: Even though devices are fast, a local JS database is generally slower than a server DB on robust hardware. There are many layers (JS -&gt; IndexedDB -&gt; possibly SQLite under the hood) that add overhead​. For example, inserting a record might go through the DB library, the storage engine, the browser's implementation, down to disk. For most UI uses this is fine (you don't need 10k writes/sec in a to-do app, you need maybe a few writes per second at most). But if your app does heavy data processing, the browser might become a bottleneck. The key question is &quot;Is it fast enough?&quot;. Often the answer is yes for typical usage, but developers must be mindful of not doing something on the client that truly requires big iron servers. For instance, full-text indexing of a million documents might be too slow in a client-side DB. Unpredictable performance is also a factor: Different users have different devices. A query that takes 50ms on a high-end desktop might take 500ms on a low-end phone in battery saving mode. So performance tuning and testing across devices is needed, and some heavy tasks might still belong on the server side​. For example if you build a local vector database you might want to create the embeddings on the server and sync them instead of creating them on the client. Client Database Migrations: As your app evolves, you'll change data models or add new fields. In a cloud-first app, you'd typically run a migration on the server database. In a local-first app, you have not only the server DB (if any) but also every client's local database to consider. Upgrading the schema means you need to write migration logic that runs on each client, perhaps the next time they launch the app after an update. Clients may be offline or not upgrade the app immediately, so you could have different versions of the schema in the wild. This complicates data handling (the sync protocol might need to handle multiple schema versions until everyone is updated). Providing a smooth migration path for local data is doable (many libraries provide migration facilities), but it requires careful testing. In a worst case, a failed migration on a client could brick the app for that user or force a full resync. This is a much bigger headache than just migrating a centralized DB at midnight while your service is in maintenance mode. 🌃 Security and Access Control: In cloud-based apps, enforcing data security (who can see what) is done on the server. The client only gets the data it's authorized to get. In a local-first scenario, you often need to partition data per user on the backend as well, to ensure users only sync down their own data (or data they have permission for). One simple strategy is to give each user their own database or dataset on the server and only replicate that. For example, CouchDB allows creating one database per user and replication can be scoped to that DB which makes permission handling easy. But if you ever need to query across users (say an admin view or aggregate analytics), having data split into many small DBs becomes a pain. The alternative is a single backend database with a fine-grained access control, and the client asks to sync only certain documents/fields. That usually means writing a custom sync server or using something like GraphQL with resolvers that respect permissions. In short, implementing auth and permissions in sync adds complexity. Also, any data stored on the client is theoretically vulnerable to extraction (if someone compromises the device or uses dev tools). You can encrypt local databases to prevent extraction after the server &quot;revokes&quot; the decryption password to mitigate the data extraction risk.  Relational Data and Complex Queries: Most client-side/offline databases are NoSQL/document oriented for flexibility in syncing and easy conflict handling. They may not support complex join queries or ACID transactions across multiple tables like a full SQL database would. This is partly because replicating a full relational model is much harder (maintaining referential integrity, etc., when data is partial on a client) or not even logically possible. For example if you have two offline clients running a complex UPDATE X WHERE Y FROM Z INNER JOIN Alice INNER JOIN Bob query and then they go online, you have no easy way of handling these conflicts. If your app has heavy relational data requirements or relies on complex server-side queries (aggregations, multi-join reports), you might find the local database either cannot do it or is too slow to do it client-side. The lack of robust relational querying is something to plan for and you might need to adjust your data model to be more document-oriented or use client-side libraries to run joins in memory. Most tools use NoSQL because it makes replication easy and implementing true relational sync would require extremely sophisticated solutions and even needing an atomic clock for full consistency across nodes (like google spanner). So, if your app truly needs SQL power on the client, local-first might complicate things. In Local-First, most tools use NoSQL because it makes replication and conflict handling easy.  That's a long list of challenges! In summary, local-first approaches introduce distributed data issues on the client side that web developers usually didn't have to deal with. Despite these challenges, the local-first movement is steadily growing because the benefits to user experience and data control are very compelling and modern tools are emerging to mitigate a lot of these difficulties. All of these are solved or solvable for your specific use-case, just keep them in mind before you start architecting your local-first app.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Local-First vs. Traditional Online-First Approaches​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why Local-First Software Is the Future and what are its Limitations","url":"/articles/local-first-future.html#local-first-vs-traditional-online-first-approaches","content":" So now that you know the pros and cons about Local-First.

Tools like PouchDB popularized the notion that developers should assume devices are often offline or have flaky connections, so apps must continue to work seamlessly without a network. The guiding principle was &quot;apps should treat being online as optional.&quot; If a user has no internet access, the application's core features still function, saving or queuing data locally, and automatically synchronizing once connectivity is restored.  This is one of the &quot;early&quot; offline-first videos:      Over time, this focus on offline support evolved into the broader concept of &quot;Local-First Software,&quot; (see Ink&amp;Switch) emphasizing not just offline operation but also the technical underpinnings of storing data locally in the client application. While offline-first is primarily about resilience to network loss, local-first highlights ownership, privacy, and performance benefits of keeping the primary data on the user's device. Most tools these days extended the original offline-first concepts, adding real-time reactivity, custom sync, and more nuances like conflict resolution or encryption.  However, the term &quot;local-first&quot; can be confusing to non-technical audiences because many people (especially in the US) associate &quot;local first&quot; with community-oriented movements that encourage buying from nearby businesses or supporting local initiatives. To reduce ambiguity, it may be clearer to use &quot;local first software&quot; or &quot;local first development&quot; in your documentation and marketing materials. When creating branding or logos around local-first software, avoid using the &quot;Google Maps Pin&quot; as a symbol.

Other local-first tools often have even fewer downloads. In comparison, a popular library like react-query, which does not focus on local storage, is downloaded about 1.6 million times a week. These numbers show that local-first libraries, while used, are not as common as some of the more traditional tools.  One reason is that local-first is still a new idea. Many developers are used to traditional &quot;online-first&quot; approaches, so switching to a local database and then syncing changes later can feel unfamiliar. Developers must learn different patterns, deal with offline synchronization, and handle possible conflicts. That extra work can be a barrier to adoption which might change in the future as tooling improves.  While most of RxDB is open source, there are also premium plugins that help sustain RxDB as a long-term project. Because people purchase these plugins, we gains insights into how developers are using local-first features:  About half of these users mainly want offline functionality for cases such as farming equipment, mining, construction, or even a shrimp farm app.The other half focus on faster, real-time UIs for to-do or reading apps, a space launch planning tool, and various dashboard apps.

These embeddings are numerical representations of data, such as text, images, or audio, created by machine learning models like MiniLM. Unlike traditional databases that work with exact matches on predefined fields, vector databases focus on semantic similarity, allowing you to query data based on meaning rather than exact values.  A vector, or embedding, is essentially an array of numbers, like [0.56, 0.12, -0.34, -0.90].  For example, instead of asking &quot;Which document has the word 'database'?&quot;, you can query &quot;Which documents discuss similar topics to this one?&quot; The vector database compares embeddings and returns results based on how similar the vectors are to each other.  Vector databases handle multiple types of data beyond text, including images, videos, and audio files, all transformed into embeddings for efficient querying. Mostly you would not train a model by yourself and instead use one of the public available transformer models.  Vector databases are highly effective in various types of applications:  Similarity Search: Finds the closest matches to a query, even when the query doesn't contain the exact terms.Clustering: Groups similar items based on the proximity of their vector representations.Recommendations: Suggests items based on shared characteristics.Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers that differ from the norm.Classification: Assigns categories to data based on its vector's nearest neighbors.  In this tutorial, we will build a vector database designed as a Similarity Search for text. For other use cases, the setup can be adapted accordingly. This flexibility is why RxDB doesn't provide a dedicated vector-database plugin, but rather offers utility functions to help you build your own vector search system.

This is where transformers.js from huggingface comes in, allowing us to run machine learning models in the browser with WebAssembly. Below is an implementation of a getEmbeddingFromText() function, which takes a piece of text and transforms it into an embedding using the Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model:  import { pipeline } from &quot;@xenova/transformers&quot;; const pipePromise = pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'); async function getEmbeddingFromText(text) { const pipe = await pipePromise; const output = await pipe(text, { pooling: &quot;mean&quot;, normalize: true, }); return Array.from(output.data); }   This function creates an embedding by running the text through a pre-trained model and returning it in the form of an array of numbers, which can then be stored and further processed locally.  note Vector embeddings from different machine learning models or versions are not compatible with each other. When you change your model, you have to recreate all embeddings for your data.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Storing the Embeddings in RxDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Local Vector Database with RxDB and transformers.js in JavaScript","url":"/articles/javascript-vector-database.html#storing-the-embeddings-in-rxdb","content":" To store the embeddings, first we have to create our RxDB Database with the localstorage storage that stores data in the browsers localstorage. For more advanced projects, you can use any other RxStorage.  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageLocalstorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-localstorage'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'mydatabase', storage: getRxStorageLocalstorage() });   Then we add a items collection that stores our documents with the text field that stores the content.  await db.addCollections({ items: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'id', type: 'object', properties: { id: { type: 'string', maxLength: 20 }, text: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['id', 'text'] } } }); const itemsCollection = db.items;   In our example repo, we use the Wiki Embeddings dataset from supabase which was transformed and used to fill up the items collection with test data.  const imported = await itemsCollection.count().exec(); const response = await fetch('./files/items.json'); const items = await response.json(); const insertResult = await itemsCollection.bulkInsert( items );   Also we need a vector collection that stores our embeddings. RxDB, as a NoSQL database, allows for the storage of flexible data structures, such as embeddings, within documents. To achieve this, we need to define a schema that specifies how the embeddings will be stored alongside each document. The schema includes fields for an id and the embedding array itself.  await db.addCollections({ vector: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'id', type: 'object', properties: { id: { type: 'string', maxLength: 20 }, embedding: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } } }, required: ['id', 'embedding'] } } }); const vectorCollection = db.vector;   When storing documents in the database, we need to ensure that the embeddings for these documents are generated and stored automatically. This requires a handler that runs during every document write, calling the machine learning model to generate the embeddings and storing them in a separate vector collection.  Since our app runs in a browser, it's essential to avoid duplicate work when multiple browser tabs are open and ensure efficient use of resources. Furthermore, we want the app to resume processing documents from where it left off if it's closed or interrupted. To achieve this, RxDB provides a pipeline plugin, which allows us to set up a workflow that processes items and stores their embeddings. In our example, a pipeline takes batches of 10 documents, generates embeddings, and stores them in a separate vector collection.  const pipeline = await itemsCollection.addPipeline({ identifier: 'my-embeddings-pipeline', destination: vectorCollection, batchSize: 10, handler: async (docs) =&gt; { await Promise.all(docs.map(async(doc) =&gt; { const embedding = await getVectorFromText(doc.text); await vectorCollection.upsert({ id: doc.primary, embedding }); })); } });   However, processing data locally presents performance challenges. Running the handler with a batch size of 10 takes around 2-4 seconds per batch, meaning processing 10k documents would take up to an hour. To improve performance, we can do parallel processing using WebWorkers. A WebWorker runs on a different JavaScript process and we can start and run many of them in parallel.  Our worker listens for messages and performance the embedding generation on each request. It then sends the result embedding back to the main thread.  // worker.js import { getVectorFromText } from './vector.js'; onmessage = async (e) =&gt; { const embedding = await getVectorFromText(e.data.text); postMessage({ id: e.data.id, embedding }); };   On the main thread we spawn one worker per core and send the tasks to the worker instead of processing them on the main thread.  // create one WebWorker per core const workers = new Array(navigator.hardwareConcurrency) .fill(0) .map(() =&gt; new Worker(new URL(&quot;worker.js&quot;, import.meta.url)));   let lastWorkerId = 0; let lastId = 0; export async function getVectorFromTextWithWorker(text: string): Promise&lt;number[]&gt; { let worker = workers[lastWorkerId++]; if(!worker) { lastWorkerId = 0; worker = workers[lastWorkerId++]; } const id = (lastId++) + ''; return new Promise&lt;number[]&gt;(res =&gt; { const listener = (ev: any) =&gt; { if (ev.data.id === id) { res(ev.data.embedding); worker.removeEventListener('message', listener); } }; worker.addEventListener('message', listener); worker.postMessage({ id, text }); }); } const pipeline = await itemsCollection.addPipeline({ identifier: 'my-embeddings-pipeline', destination: vectorCollection, batchSize: navigator.hardwareConcurrency, // one per CPU core handler: async (docs) =&gt; { await Promise.all(docs.map(async (doc, i) =&gt; { const embedding = await getVectorFromTextWithWorker(doc.body); /* ... */ }); } });   This setup allows us to utilize the full hardware capacity of the client's machine. By setting the batch size to match the number of logical processors available (using the navigator.hardwareConcurrency API) and running one worker per processor, we can reduce the processing time for 10k embeddings to about 5 minutes on my developer laptop with 32 CPU cores.

Various methods are available to measure the similarity or difference between two vectors, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Cosine similarity, and Jaccard similarity (and more). RxDB provides utility functions for each of these methods, making it easy to choose the most suitable method for your application. In this tutorial, we will use Euclidean distance to compare vectors. However, the ideal algorithm may vary depending on your data's distribution and the specific type of query you are performing. To find the optimal method for your app, it is up to you to try out all of these and compare the results.  Each method gets two vectors as input and returns a single number. Here's how to calculate the Euclidean distance between two embeddings with the vector utilities from RxDB:  import { euclideanDistance } from 'rxdb/plugins/vector'; const distance = euclideanDistance(embedding1, embedding2); console.log(distance); // 25.20443   With this we can sort multiple embeddings by how good they match our search query vector.

In this query, we aim to find documents similar to a given user input text. The process involves calculating the embedding from the input text, fetching all documents, calculating the distance between their embeddings and the query embedding, and then sorting them based on their similarity.  import { euclideanDistance } from 'rxdb/plugins/vector'; import { sortByObjectNumberProperty } from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; const userInput = 'new york people'; const queryVector = await getEmbeddingFromText(userInput); const candidates = await vectorCollection.find().exec(); const withDistance = candidates.map(doc =&gt; ({ doc, distance: euclideanDistance(queryVector, doc.embedding) })); const queryResult = withDistance.sort(sortByObjectNumberProperty('distance')).reverse(); console.dir(queryResult);   note For distance-based comparisons, sorting should be in ascending order (smallest first), while for similarity-based algorithms, the sorting should be in descending order (largest first).  If we inspect the results, we can see that the documents returned are ordered by relevance, with the most similar document at the top:    note This demo page can be run online here.  However our full-scan method presents a significant challenge: it does not scale well. As the number of stored documents increases, the time taken to fetch and compare embeddings grows proportionally. For example, retrieving embeddings from our test dataset of 10k documents takes around 700 milliseconds. If we scale up to 100k documents, this delay would rise to approximately 7 seconds, making the search process inefficient for larger datasets.

In traditional databases, you can sort documents by an index field, allowing efficient queries that retrieve only the necessary documents. An index organizes data in a structured, sortable manner, much like a phone book. However, with vector embeddings we are not dealing with simple, single values. Instead, we have large lists of numbers, which makes indexing more complex because we have more than one dimension.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Vector Indexing Methods​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Local Vector Database with RxDB and transformers.js in JavaScript","url":"/articles/javascript-vector-database.html#vector-indexing-methods","content":" Various methods exist for indexing these vectors to improve query efficiency and performance:  Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH): LSH hashes data so that similar items are likely to fall into the same bucket, optimizing approximate nearest neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces by reducing the number of comparisons.Hierarchical Small World: HSW is a graph structure designed for efficient navigation, allowing quick jumps across the graph while maintaining short paths between nodes, forming the basis for HNSW's optimization.Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW): HNSW builds a hierarchical graph for fast approximate nearest neighbor search. It uses multiple layers where higher layers represent fewer, more connected nodes, improving search efficiency in large datasets​.Distance to samples: While testing different indexing strategies, I found out that using the distance to a sample set of items is a good way to index embeddings. You pick like 5 random items of your data and get the embeddings for them out of the model. These are your 5 index vectors. For each embedding stored in the vector database, we calculate the distance to our 5 index vectors and store that number as an index value. This seems to work good because similar things have similar distances to other things. For example the words &quot;shoe&quot; and &quot;socks&quot; have a similar distance to &quot;boat&quot; and therefore should have roughly the same index value.  When building local-first applications, performance is often a challenge, especially in JavaScript. With IndexedDB, certain operations, like many sequential get by id calls, are slow, while bulk operations, such as get by index range, are fast. Therefore, it's essential to use an indexing method that allows embeddings to be stored in a sortable way, like Locality Sensitive Hashing or Distance to Samples. In this article, we'll use Distance to Samples, because for me it provides the best default behavior for the sample dataset.

To ensure that the index values are both sortable and precise, we convert them into strings with a fixed length of 10 characters. This standardization helps in managing values with many decimals and ensures proper sorting in the database.  Here's is our schema example schema where each document contains an embedding and corresponding index fields:  const indexSchema = { type: 'string', maxLength: 10 }; const schema = { &quot;version&quot;: 0, &quot;primaryKey&quot;: &quot;id&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;maxLength&quot;: 100 }, &quot;embedding&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;array&quot;, &quot;items&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;number&quot; } }, // index fields &quot;idx0&quot;: indexSchema, &quot;idx1&quot;: indexSchema, &quot;idx2&quot;: indexSchema, &quot;idx3&quot;: indexSchema, &quot;idx4&quot;: indexSchema }, &quot;required&quot;: [ &quot;id&quot;, &quot;embedding&quot;, &quot;idx0&quot;, &quot;idx1&quot;, &quot;idx2&quot;, &quot;idx3&quot;, &quot;idx4&quot; ], &quot;indexes&quot;: [ &quot;idx0&quot;, &quot;idx1&quot;, &quot;idx2&quot;, &quot;idx3&quot;, &quot;idx4&quot; ] }   To populate these index fields, we modify the RxPipeline handler accordingly to the Distance to samples method.

While this indexing method boosts performance, it comes with a tradeoff: a slight loss in precision, meaning that the result set may not always be the optimal one. However, this is generally acceptable for similarity search use cases.  There are multiple ways to leverage indexes for faster queries. Here are two effective methods:  Query for Index Similarity in Both Directions: For each index vector, calculate the distance to the search embedding and fetch all relevant embeddings in both directions (sorted before and after) from that value.  async function vectorSearchIndexSimilarity(searchEmbedding: number[]) { const docsPerIndexSide = 100; const candidates = new Set&lt;RxDocument&gt;(); await Promise.all( new Array(5).fill(0).map(async (_, i) =&gt; { const distanceToIndex = euclideanDistance(sampleVectors[i], searchEmbedding); const [docsBefore, docsAfter] = await Promise.all([ vectorCollection.find({ selector: { ['idx' + i]: { $lt: indexNrToString(distanceToIndex) } }, sort: [{ ['idx' + i]: 'desc' }], limit: docsPerIndexSide }).exec(), vectorCollection.find({ selector: { ['idx' + i]: { $gt: indexNrToString(distanceToIndex) } }, sort: [{ ['idx' + i]: 'asc' }], limit: docsPerIndexSide }).exec() ]); docsBefore.map(d =&gt; candidates.add(d)); docsAfter.map(d =&gt; candidates.add(d)); }) ); const docsWithDistance = Array.from(candidates).map(doc =&gt; { const distance = euclideanDistance((doc as any).embedding, searchEmbedding); return { distance, doc }; }); const sorted = docsWithDistance.sort(sortByObjectNumberProperty('distance')).reverse(); return { result: sorted.slice(0, 10), docReads }; }   Query for an Index Range with a Defined Distance: Set an indexDistance and retrieve all embeddings within a specified range from the index vector to the search embedding.  async function vectorSearchIndexRange(searchEmbedding: number[]) { await pipeline.awaitIdle(); const indexDistance = 0.003; const candidates = new Set&lt;RxDocument&gt;(); let docReads = 0; await Promise.all( new Array(5).fill(0).map(async (_, i) =&gt; { const distanceToIndex = euclideanDistance(sampleVectors[i], searchEmbedding); const range = distanceToIndex * indexDistance; const docs = await vectorCollection.find({ selector: { ['idx' + i]: { $gt: indexNrToString(distanceToIndex - range), $lt: indexNrToString(distanceToIndex + range) } }, sort: [{ ['idx' + i]: 'asc' }], }).exec(); docs.map(d =&gt; candidates.add(d)); docReads = docReads + docs.length; }) ); const docsWithDistance = Array.from(candidates).map(doc =&gt; { const distance = euclideanDistance((doc as any).embedding, searchEmbedding); return { distance, doc }; }); const sorted = docsWithDistance.sort(sortByObjectNumberProperty('distance')).reverse(); return { result: sorted.slice(0, 10), docReads }; };   Both methods allow you to limit the number of embeddings fetched from storage while still ensuring a reasonably precise search result. However, they differ in how many embeddings are read and how precise the results are, with trade-offs between performance and accuracy. The first method has a known embedding read amount of docsPerIndexSide * 2 * [amount of indexes]. The second method reads out an unknown amount of embeddings, depending on the sparsity of the dataset and the value of indexDistance.  And that's it for the implementation.

Therefore, when building a local-first app that processes more than a few documents, performance becomes a critical factor and should be thoroughly tested upfront.

To do that, you just strip away numbers from your vector. For example [0.56, 0.12, -0.34, 0.78, -0.90] becomes [0.56, 0.12]. That's it, you now have a smaller embedding that is faster to read out of the storage and calculating distances is faster because it has to process less numbers. The downside is that you loose precision in your search results. Sometimes shortening the embeddings makes more sense as a pre-query step where you first compare the shortened vectors and later fetch the &quot;real&quot; vectors for the 10 most matching documents to improve their sort order. Optimize the variables in our Setup: In this examples we picked our variables in a non-optimal way. You can get huge performance improvements by setting different values: We picked 5 indexes for the embeddings. Using less indexes improves your query performance with the cost of less good results.For queries that search by fetching a specific embedding distance we used the indexDistance value of 0.003. Using a lower value means we read less document from the storage. This is faster but reduces the precision of the results which means we will get a less optimal result compared to a full table scan.For queries that search by fetching a given amount of documents per index side, we set the value docsPerIndexSide to 100. Increasing this value means you fetch more data from the storage but also get a better precision in the search results. Decreasing it can improve query performance with worse precision. Use faster models: There are many ways to improve performance of machine learning models. If your embedding calculation is too slow, try other models. Smaller mostly means faster. The model Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 which is used in this tutorial is about 1 year old. There exist better, more modern models to use. Huggingface makes these convenient to use. You only have to switch out the model name with any other model from that site. Narrow down the search space: By utilizing other &quot;normal&quot; filter operators to your query, you can narrow down the search space and optimize performance. For example in an email search you could additionally use a operator that limits the results to all emails that are not older than one year. Dimensionality Reduction with an autoencoder: An autoencoder encodes vector data with minimal loss which can improve the performance by having to store and compare less numbers in an embedding.

Real-time computing is a type of computer processing that guarantees specific response times for tasks or events, crucial in applications like industrial control, automotive systems, and aerospace. It relies on specialized operating systems (RTOS) to ensure predictability and low latency. Hard real-time systems must never miss deadlines, while soft real-time systems can tolerate occasional delays. Real-time responses are often understood to be in the order of milliseconds, and sometimes microseconds.  Consider the role of real-time computing in car airbags: sensors detect collision force, swiftly process the data, and immediately decide to deploy the airbags within milliseconds. Such rapid action is imperative for safeguarding passengers. Hence, the controlling chip must guarantee a certain response time - it must operate in &quot;realtime&quot;.  But when people talk about realtime databases, especially in the web-development world, they almost never mean realtime, as in realtime computing, they mean something else. In fact, with any programming language that run on end users devices, it is not even possible to built a &quot;real&quot; realtime database. A program, like a JavaScript (browser or Node.js) process, can be halted by the operating systems task manager at any time and therefore it will never be able to guarantee specific response times. To build a realtime computing database, you would need a realtime capable operating system.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Real time Database as in realtime replication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is a realtime database?","url":"/articles/realtime-database.html#real-time-database-as-in-realtime-replication","content":" When talking about realtime databases, most people refer to realtime, as in realtime replication. Often they mean a very specific product which is the Firebase Realtime Database (not the Firestore).    In the context of the Firebase Realtime Database, &quot;realtime&quot; means that data changes are synchronized and delivered to all connected clients or devices as soon as they occur, typically within milliseconds. This means that when any client updates, adds, or removes data in the database, all other clients that are connected to the same database instance receive those updates instantly, without the need for manual polling or frequent HTTP requests.  In short, when replicating data between databases, instead of polling, we use a websocket connection to live-stream all changes between the server and the clients, this is labeled as &quot;realtime database&quot;. A similar thing can be done with RxDB and the RxDB Replication Plugins.    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Realtime as in realtime applications​","type":1,"pageTitle":"What is a realtime database?","url":"/articles/realtime-database.html#realtime-as-in-realtime-applications","content":" In the context of realtime client-side applications, &quot;realtime&quot; refers to the immediate or near-instantaneous processing and response to events or data inputs. When data changes, the application must directly update to reflect the new data state, without any user interaction or delay. Notice that the change to the data could have come from any source, like a user action, an operation in another browser tab, or even an operation from another device that has been replicated to the client.    In contrast to push-pull based databases (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB servers), a realtime database contains features which make it easy to build realtime applications. For example with RxDB you can not only fetch query results once, but instead you can subscribe to a query and directly update the HTML dom tree whenever the query has a new result set:  await db.heroes.find({ selector: { healthpoints: { $gt: 0 } } }) .$ // The $ returns an observable that emits whenever the query's result set changes. .subscribe(aliveHeroes =&gt; { // Refresh the HTML list each time there are new query results. const newContent = aliveHeroes.map(doc =&gt; '&lt;li&gt;' + doc.name + '&lt;/li&gt;'); document.getElementById('#myList').innerHTML = newContent; }); // You can even subscribe to any RxDB document's fields. myDocument.firstName$.subscribe(newName =&gt; console.log('name is: ' + newName));   A competent realtime application is engineered to offer feedback or results swiftly, ideally within milliseconds to microseconds. Ideally, a data modification should be processed in under 16 milliseconds (since 1 second divided by 60 frames equals 16.66ms) to ensure users don't perceive any lag from input to visualization. RxDB utilizes the EventReduce algorithm to manage changes more swiftly than 16ms. However, it can never assure fixed response times as a &quot;realtime computing database&quot; would.

It maintains a checkpoint-based mechanism, so only new or updated documents flow between the client and server, reducing bandwidth usage and latency. This ensures:  Live Data: Queries automatically reflect server-side changes once they arrive locally.Background Updates: No manual polling needed; replication streams or intervals handle synchronization.Conflict Handling (see below) ensures data merges gracefully when multiple clients edit the same document offline.  Multiple Replication Plugins and Approaches​  RxDB's flexible replication system lets you connect to different backends or even peer-to-peer networks. There are official plugins for CouchDB, Firestore, GraphQL, WebRTC, and more. Many developers create a custom HTTP replication to work with their existing REST-based backend, ensuring a painless integration that doesn't require adopting an entirely new server infrastructure.

Once connectivity resumes, changes sync to the server automatically (if replication is configured).  Example Setup of the replication​  import { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication'; async function syncLocalTasks(db) { replicateRxCollection({ collection: db.tasks, replicationIdentifier: 'sync-tasks', // Define how to pull server documents and push local documents pull: { handler: async (lastCheckpoint, batchSize) =&gt; { // logic to retrieve updated tasks from the server since lastCheckpoint }, }, push: { handler: async (docs) =&gt; { // logic to post local changes to the server }, }, live: true, // continuously replicate retryTime: 5000, // retry on errors or disconnections }); }   This replication seamlessly merges server-side and client-side changes.

For example, when a user updates a task document to done: true, the UI can re-render immediately with that new state. This even works across multiple browser tabs.

The technique emulates server push communications with normal XHR requests. Unlike traditional polling, where the client repeatedly requests data from the server at regular intervals, long polling establishes a connection to the server that remains open until new data is available. Once the server has new information, it sends the response to the client, and the connection is closed. Immediately after receiving the server's response, the client initiates a new request, and the process repeats. This method allows for more immediate data updates and reduces unnecessary network traffic and server load. However, it can still introduce delays in communication and is less efficient than other real-time technologies like WebSockets.  // long-polling in a JavaScript client function longPoll() { fetch('http://example.com/poll') .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(data =&gt; { console.log(&quot;Received data:&quot;, data); longPoll(); // Immediately establish a new long polling request }) .catch(error =&gt; { /** * Errors can appear in normal conditions when a * connection timeout is reached or when the client goes offline. * On errors we just restart the polling after some delay. */ setTimeout(longPoll, 10000); }); } longPoll(); // Initiate the long polling   Implementing long-polling on the client side is pretty simple, as shown in the code above.

This technology enables browsers and servers to exchange data without the overhead of HTTP request-response cycles, facilitating real-time data transfer for applications like live chat, gaming, or financial trading platforms. WebSockets represent a significant advancement over traditional HTTP by allowing both parties to send data independently once the connection is established, making it ideal for scenarios that require low latency and high-frequency updates.  // WebSocket in a JavaScript client const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com'); socket.onopen = function(event) { console.log('Connection established'); // Sending a message to the server socket.send('Hello Server!'); }; socket.onmessage = function(event) { console.log('Message from server:', event.data); };   While the basics of the WebSocket API are easy to use it has shown to be rather complex in production. A socket can loose connection and must be re-created accordingly. Especially detecting if a connection is still usable or not, can be very tricky. Mostly you would add a ping-and-pong heartbeat to ensure that the open connection is not closed. This complexity is why most people use a library on top of WebSockets like Socket.IO which handles all these cases and even provides fallbacks to long-polling if required.

Unlike WebSockets, SSEs are designed exclusively for one-way communication from server to client, making them ideal for scenarios like live news feeds, sports scores, or any situation where the client needs to be updated in real time without sending data to the server.  You can think of Server-Sent-Events as a single HTTP request where the backend does not send the whole body at once, but instead keeps the connection open and trickles the answer by sending a single line each time an event has to be send to the client.  Creating a connection for receiving events with SSE is straightforward. On the client side in a browser, you initialize an EventSource instance with the URL of the server-side script that generates the events.  Listening for messages involves attaching event handlers directly to the EventSource instance. The API distinguishes between generic message events and named events, allowing for more structured communication. Here's how you can set it up in JavaScript:  // Connecting to the server-side event stream const evtSource = new EventSource(&quot;https://example.com/events&quot;); // Handling generic message events evtSource.onmessage = event =&gt; { console.log('got message: ' + event.data); };   In difference to WebSockets, an EventSource will automatically reconnect on connection loss.  On the server side, your script must set the Content-Type header to text/event-stream and format each message according to the SSE specification. This includes specifying event types, data payloads, and optional fields like event ID and retry timing.  Here's how you can set up a simple SSE endpoint in a Node.js Express app:  import express from 'express'; const app = express(); const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000; app.get('/events', (req, res) =&gt; { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', }); const sendEvent = (data) =&gt; { // all message lines must be prefixed with 'data: ' const formattedData = `data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\\n\\n`; res.write(formattedData); }; // Send an event every 2 seconds const intervalId = setInterval(() =&gt; { const message = { time: new Date().toTimeString(), message: 'Hello from the server!', }; sendEvent(message); }, 2000); // Clean up when the connection is closed req.on('close', () =&gt; { clearInterval(intervalId); res.end(); }); }); app.listen(PORT, () =&gt; console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"What is the WebTransport API?​","type":1,"pageTitle":"WebSockets vs Server-Sent-Events vs Long-Polling vs WebRTC vs WebTransport","url":"/articles/websockets-sse-polling-webrtc-webtransport.html#what-is-the-webtransport-api","content":" WebTransport is a cutting-edge API designed for efficient, low-latency communication between web clients and servers. It leverages the HTTP/3 QUIC protocol to enable a variety of data transfer capabilities, such as sending data over multiple streams, in both reliable and unreliable manners, and even allowing data to be sent out of order. This makes WebTransport a powerful tool for applications requiring high-performance networking, such as real-time gaming, live streaming, and collaborative platforms. However, it's important to note that WebTransport is currently a working draft and has not yet achieved widespread adoption. As of now (March 2024), WebTransport is in a Working Draft and not widely supported. You cannot yet use WebTransport in the Safari browser and there is also no native support in Node.js. This limits its usability across different platforms and environments.  Even when WebTransport will become widely supported, its API is very complex to use and likely it would be something where people build libraries on top of WebTransport, not using it directly in an application's sourcecode.

It supports peer-to-peer connections for streaming audio, video, and data exchange between browsers. WebRTC is designed to work through NATs and firewalls, utilizing protocols like ICE, STUN, and TURN to establish a connection between peers.  While WebRTC is made to be used for client-client interactions, it could also be leveraged for server-client communication where the server just simulated being also a client. This approach only makes sense for niche use cases which is why in the following WebRTC will be ignored as an option.  The problem is that for WebRTC to work, you need a signaling-server anyway which would then again run over websockets, SSE or WebTransport. This defeats the purpose of using WebRTC as a replacement for these technologies.

While it would also be possible with Long-Polling in theory, it is not recommended because sending &quot;new&quot; data to an existing long-polling connection would require to do an additional http-request anyway. So instead of doing that you can send data directly from the client to the server with an additional http-request without interrupting the long-polling connection.  Server-Sent-Events do not support sending any additional data to the server. You can only do the initial request, and even there you cannot send POST-like data in the http-body by default with the native EventSource API. Instead you have to put all data inside of the url parameters which is considered a bad practice for security because credentials might leak into server logs, proxies and caches. To fix this problem, RxDB for example uses the eventsource polyfill instead of the native EventSource API. This library adds additional functionality like sending custom http headers. Also there is this library from microsoft which allows to send body data and use POST requests instead of GET.

The limitation of six connections is even shared across browser tabs so when you open the same page in multiple tabs, they would have to shared the six-connection-pool with each other. This limitation is part of the HTTP/1.1-RFC (which even defines a lower number of only two connections).  Quote From RFC 2616 - Section 8.1.4: &quot;Clients that use persistent connections SHOULD limit the number of simultaneous connections that they maintain to a given server. A single-user client SHOULD NOT maintain more than 2 connections with any server or proxy. A proxy SHOULD use up to 2*N connections to another server or proxy, where N is the number of simultaneously active users. These guidelines are intended to improve HTTP response times and avoid congestion.&quot;  While that policy makes sense to prevent website owners from using their visitors to D-DOS other websites, it can be a big problem when multiple connections are required to handle server-client communication for legitimate use cases. To workaround the limitation you have to use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 with which the browser will only open a single connection per domain and then use multiplexing to run all data through a single connection. While this gives you a virtually infinity amount of parallel connections, there is a SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS setting which limits the actually connections amount. The default is 100 concurrent streams for most configurations.  In theory the connection limit could also be increased by the browser, at least for specific APIs like EventSource, but the issues have been marked as &quot;won't fix&quot; by chromium and firefox.  Lower the amount of connections in Browser Apps When you build a browser application, you have to assume that your users will use the app not only once, but in multiple browser tabs in parallel. By default you likely will open one server-stream-connection per tab which is often not necessary at all. Instead you open only a single connection and shared it between tabs, no matter how many tabs are open. RxDB does that with the LeaderElection from the broadcast-channel npm package to only have one stream of replication between server and clients. You can use that package standalone (without RxDB) for any type of application.

Here we can see that the performance of WebSockets, WebRTC and WebTransport are comparable:    note Remember that WebTransport is a pretty new technology based on the also new HTTP/3 protocol.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) emerge as the most straightforward option to implement, leveraging the same HTTP/S protocols as traditional web requests, thereby circumventing corporate firewall restrictions and other technical problems that can appear with other protocols. They are easily integrated into Node.js and other server frameworks, making them an ideal choice for applications requiring frequent server-to-client updates, such as news feeds, stock tickers, and live event streaming.  On the other hand, WebSockets excel in scenarios demanding ongoing, two-way communication. Their ability to support continuous interaction makes them the prime choice for browser games, chat applications, and live sports updates.  However, WebTransport, despite its potential, faces adoption challenges. It is not widely supported by server frameworks including Node.js and lacks compatibility with safari. Moreover, its reliance on HTTP/3 further limits its immediate applicability because many WebServers like nginx only have experimental HTTP/3 support. While promising for future applications with its support for both reliable and unreliable data transmission, WebTransport is not yet a viable option for most use cases.  Long-Polling, once a common technique, is now largely outdated due to its inefficiency and the high overhead of repeatedly establishing new HTTP connections. Although it may serve as a fallback in environments lacking support for WebSockets or SSE, its use is generally discouraged due to significant performance limitations.

This missed out events are not relevant when the server is streaming the full content each time anyway, like on a live updating stock ticker. But when the backend is made to stream partial results, you have to account for missed out events. Fixing that on the backend scales pretty bad because the backend would have to remember for each client which events have been successfully send already. Instead this should be implemented with client side logic.  The RxDB Sync Engine for example uses two modes of operation for that. One is the checkpoint iteration mode where normal http requests are used to iterate over backend data, until the client is in sync again. Then it can switch to event observation mode where updates from the realtime-stream are used to keep the client in sync. Whenever a client disconnects or has any error, the replication shortly switches to checkpoint iteration mode until the client is in sync again. This method accounts for missed out events and ensures that clients can always sync to the exact equal state of the server.

You need to load the full dataset on the first pageload and on every ongoing load you need to download the new changes to that set. While in theory you could download in infinite amount of data, in practice you have a limit how long the user can wait before having an up-to-date state. You want to display chat messages like Whatsapp? No problem. Syncing all the messages a user could write, can be done with a few HTTP requests. Want to make a tool that displays server logs? Good luck downloading terabytes of data to the client just to search for a single string. This will not work.  Besides the network usage, there is another limit for the size of your data. In browsers you have some options for storage: Cookies, Localstorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.  Because Cookies and Localstorage is slow and WebSQL is deprecated, you will use IndexedDB. The limit of how much data you can store in IndexedDB depends on two factors: Which browser is used and how much disc space is left on the device. You can assume that at least a couple of hundred megabytes are available at least. The maximum is potentially hundreds of gigabytes or more, but the browser implementations vary. Chrome allows the browser to use up to 60% of the total disc space per origin. Firefox allows up to 50%. But on safari you can only store up to 1GB and the browser will prompt the user on each additional 200MB increment.  The problem is, that you have no chance to really predict how much data can be stored. So you have to make assumptions that are hopefully true for all of your users. Also, you have no way to increase that space like you would add another hard drive to your backend server. Once your clients reach the limit, you likely have to rewrite big parts of your applications.  UPDATE (2023): Newer versions of browsers can store way more data, for example firefox stores up to 10% of the total disk size. For an overview about how much can be stored, read this guide  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Browser storage is not really persistent​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#browser-storage-is-not-really-persistent","content":" When data is stored inside IndexedDB or one of the other storage APIs, it cannot be trusted to stay there forever. Apple for example deletes the data when the website was not used in the last 7 days. The other browsers also have logic to clean up the stored data, and in the end the user itself could be the one that deletes the browsers local data.  The most common way to handle this, is to replicate everything from the backend to the client again. Of course, this does not work for state that is not stored at the backend. So if you assume you can store the users private data inside the browser in a secure way, you are wrong.    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"There can be conflicts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#there-can-be-conflicts","content":" Imagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.    The default in many offline first databases is a deterministic conflict resolution strategy. Both conflicting versions of the document are kept in the storage and when you query for the document, a winner is determined by comparing the hashes of the document and only the winning document is returned. Because the comparison is deterministic, all clients and servers will always pick the same winner. This kind of resolution only works when it is not that important that one of the document changes gets dropped. Because conflicts are rare, this might be a viable solution for some use cases. A better resolution can be applied by listening to the changestream of the database. The changestream emits an event each time a write happens to the database. The event contains information about the written document and also a flag if there is a conflicting version. For each event with a conflict, you fetch all versions for that document and create a new document that contains the winning state. With that you can implement pretty complex conflict resolution strategies, but you have to manually code it for each collection of documents. Instead of the solving conflict once at every client, it can be made a bit easier by solely relying on the backend. This can be done when all of your clients replicate with the same single backend server. With RxDB's Graphql Replication each client side change is sent to the server where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients. Sometimes there is no way to solve a conflict with code. If your users edit text based documents or images, often only the users themselves can decide how the winning revision has to look. For these cases, you have to implement complex UI parts where the users can inspect the conflict and manage its resolution. You do not have to handle conflicts if they cannot happen in the first place. You can achieve that by designing a write only database where existing documents cannot be touched. Instead of storing the current state in a single document, you store all the events that lead to the current state. Sometimes called the &quot;everything is a delta&quot; strategy, others would call it Event Sourcing. Like an accountant that does not need an eraser, you append all changes and afterwards aggregate the current state at the client.  // create one new document for each change to the users balance {id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 100} // balance increased by $100 {id: new Date().toJSON(), change: -50} // balance decreased by $50 {id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 200} // balance increased by $200   There is this thing called conflict-free replicated data type, short CRDT. Using a CRDT library like automerge will magically solve all of your conflict problems. Until you use it in production where you observe that implementing CRDTs has basically the same complexity as implementing conflict resolution strategies.

Each change on one side directly changes the state of the other sides in realtime. But this &quot;realtime&quot; is not the same as in realtime computing. In the offline first world, the word realtime was introduced by firebase and is more meant as a marketing slogan than a technical description. There is an internet between your backend and your clients and everything you do on one machine takes at least once the latency until it can affect anything on the other machines. You have to keep this in mind when you develop anything where the timing is important, like a multiplayer game or a stock trading app.  Even when you run a query against the local database, there is no &quot;real&quot; realtime. Client side databases run on JavaScript and JavaScript runs on a single CPU that might be partially blocked because the user is running some background processes. So you can never guarantee a response deadline which violates the time constraint of realtime computing.    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Eventual consistency​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#eventual-consistency","content":" An offline first app does not have a single source of truth. There is a source on the backend, one on the own client, and also each other client has its own definition of truth. At the moment your user starts the app, the local state is hopefully already replicated with the backend and all other clients. But this does not have to be true, the states can have converged and you have to plan for that. The user could update a document based on wrong assumptions because it was not fully replicated at that point in time because the user is offline. A good way to handle this problem is to show the replication state in the UI and tell the user when the replication is running, stopped, paused or finished.  And some data is just too important to be &quot;eventual consistent&quot;. Create a wire transfer in your online banking app while you are offline. You keep the smartphone laying at your night desk and when you use again in the next morning, it goes online and replicates the transaction. No thank you, do not use offline first for these kinds of things, or at least you have to display the replication state of each document in the UI.    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Permissions and authentication​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#permissions-and-authentication","content":" Every offline first app that goes beyond a prototype, does likely not have the same global state for all of its users. Each user has a different set of documents that are allowed to be replicated or seen by the user. So you need some kind of authentication and permission handling to divide the documents. The easy way is to just create one database for each user on the backend and only allow to replicate that one. Creating that many databases is not really a problem with for example CouchDB, and it makes permission handling easy. But as soon as you want to query all of your data in the backend, it will bite back. Your data is not at a single place, it is distributed between all of the user specific databases. This becomes even more complex as soon as you store information together with the documents that is not allowed to be seen by outsiders. You not only have to decide which documents to replicate, but also which fields of them.  So what you really want is a single datastore in the backend and then replicate only the allowed document parts to each of the users. This always requires you to implement your custom replication endpoint like what you do with RxDBs GraphQL Replication.

You want to add some new fields to documents or change the format of them. So you have to update the database schema and also migrate the stored documents. With 'normal' applications, this is already hard enough and often dangerous. You wait until midnight, stop the webserver, make a database backup, deploy the new schema and then you hope that nothing goes wrong while it updates that many documents.  With offline first applications, it is even more fun. You do not only have to migrate your local backend database, you also have to provide a migration strategy for all of these client databases out there. And you also cannot migrate everything at the same time. The clients can only migrate when the new code was updated from the appstore or the user visited your website again. This could be today or in a few weeks.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Performance is not native​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#performance-is-not-native","content":" When you create a web based offline first app, you cannot store data directly on the users filesystem. In fact there are many layers between your JavaScript code and the filesystem of the operation system. Let's say you insert a document in RxDB:  You call the RxDB API to validate and store the dataRxDB calls the underlying RxStorage, for example PouchDB.Pouchdb calls its underlying storage adapterThe storage adapter calls IndexedDBThe browser runs its internal handling of the IndexedDB APIIn most browsers IndexedDB is implemented on top of SQLiteSQLite calls the OS to store the data in the filesystem  All these layers are abstractions. They are not build for exactly that one use case, so you lose some performance to tunnel the data through the layer itself, and you also lose some performance because the abstraction does not exactly provide the functions that are needed by the layer above and it will overfetch data.  You will not find a benchmark comparison between how many transactions per second you can run on the browser compared to a server based database. Because it makes no sense to compare them. Browsers are slower, JavaScript is slower.  Is it fast enough?  What you really care about is &quot;Is it fast enough?&quot;. For most use cases, the answer is yes. Offline first apps are UI based and you do not need to process a million transactions per second, because your user will not click the save button that often. &quot;Fast enough&quot; means that the data is processed in under 16 milliseconds so that you can render the updated UI in the next frame. This is of course not true for all use cases, so you better think about the performance limit before starting with the implementation.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Nothing is predictable​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#nothing-is-predictable","content":" You have a PostgreSQL database and run a query over 1000ths of rows, which takes 200 milliseconds. Works great, so you now want to do something similar at the client device in your offline first app. How long does it take? You cannot know because people have different devices, and even equal devices have different things running in the background that slow the CPUs. So you cannot predict performance and as described above, you cannot even predict the storage limit. So if your app does heavy data analytics, you might better run everything on the backend and just send the results to the client.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"There is no relational data​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Downsides of Local First / Offline First","url":"/downsides-of-offline-first.html#there-is-no-relational-data","content":" I started creating RxDB many years ago and while still maintaining it, I often worked with all these other offline first databases out there. RxDB and all of these other ones, are based on some kind of document databases similar to NoSQL. Often people want to have a relational database like the SQL one they use at the backend.  So why are there no real relations in offline first databases? I could answer with these arguments like how JavaScript works better with document based data, how performance is better when having no joins or even how NoSQL queries are more composable. But the truth is, everything is NoSQL because it makes replication easy. An SQL query that mutates data in different tables based on some selects and joins, cannot be partially replicated without breaking the client. You have foreign keys that point to other rows and if these rows are not replicated yet, you have a problem. To implement a robust Sync Engine for relational data, you need some stuff like a reliable atomic clock and you have to block queries over multiple tables while a transaction replicated. Watch this guy implementing offline first replication on top of SQLite or read this discussion about implementing offline first in supabase.  So creating replication for an SQL offline first database is way more work than just adding some network protocols on top of PostgreSQL. It might not even be possible for clients that have no reliable clock.

In theory, you could ship the correct database server binaries with your electron application and start a process on the client's device that exposes a port to the database that can be consumed by Electron. In practice, this is not a viable way to go because shipping the correct binaries and opening ports is way to complicated and troublesome. Instead you should use a database that can be bundled and run inside of Electron, either in the main or in the renderer process.

This is easy to set up and storing small sets of data can be achieved in a short span of time.  But as soon as your application goes beyond a simple TODO-app, there are multiple obstacles that come in your way. One thing is the bad multi-tab support. If you have more than one renderer process, it becomes hard to manage database writes between them. Each browser tab could modify the database state while the others do not know of the changes and keep an outdated UI.  Another thing is performance. IndexedDB is slow, mostly because it has to go through layers of browser security and abstractions. Storing and querying a lot of data might become your performance bottleneck. Localstorage and WebSQL are even slower, by the way. Using these Web Storage APIs is generally only recommended when you know for sure that there will be always only one rendering process and performance is not that relevant. The main reason for that is the security- and abstraction layers that write- and read operations have to go through when using the browsers IndexedDB API. So instead of using IndexedDB in Electron in the renderer process, you should use something that runs in the &quot;main&quot; process in Node.js like the Filesystem RxStorage or the In Memory RxStorage.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"RxDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Electron Database - RxDB with different storage for SQLite, Filesystem and In-Memory","url":"/electron-database.html#rxdb","content":"   RxDB is a NoSQL database for JavaScript applications. It has many features that come in handy when RxDB is used with UI based applications like your Electron app. For example, it is able to subscribe to query results of single fields of documents. It has encryption and compression features and most important it has a battle tested Sync Engine that can be used to do a realtime sync with your backend.  Because of the flexible storage layer of RxDB, there are many options on how to use it with Electron:  The memory RxStorage that stores the data inside of the JavaScript memory without persistenceThe SQLite RxStorageThe IndexedDB RxStorageThe LocalStorage RxStorageThe Dexie.js RxStorageThe Node.js Filesystem  It is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage because it has the best performance and is the easiest to set up. However it is part of the 👑 Premium Plugins which must be purchased, so to try out RxDB with Electron, you might want to use one of the other options. To start with RxDB, I would recommend using the LocalStorage RxStorage in the renderer processes. Because RxDB is able to broadcast the database state between browser tabs, having multiple renderer processes is not a problem like it would be when you use plain IndexedDB without RxDB. In production, you would always run the RxStorage in the main process with the RxStorage Electron IpcRenderer &amp; IpcMain plugins.  First, you have to install all dependencies via npm install rxdb rxjs. Then you can assemble the RxStorage and create a database with it:  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageLocalstorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-localstorage'; // create database const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'exampledb', storage: getRxStorageLocalstorage() }); // create collections const collections = await myRxDatabase.addCollections({ humans: { /* ... */ } }); // insert document await collections.humans.insert({id: 'foo', name: 'bar'}); // run a query const result = await collections.humans.find({ selector: { name: 'bar' } }).exec(); // observe a query await collections.humans.find({ selector: { name: 'bar' } }).$.subscribe(result =&gt; {/* ... */});   For better performance in the renderer tab, you can later switch to the IndexedDB RxStorage. But in production, it is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage or the Filesystem RxStorage in the main process so that database operations do not block the rendering of the UI.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"SQLite in Electron.js without RxDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Electron Database - RxDB with different storage for SQLite, Filesystem and In-Memory","url":"/electron-database.html#sqlite-in-electronjs-without-rxdb","content":" SQLite is a SQL based relational database written in the C programming language that was crafted to be embedded inside of applications and stores data locally. Operations are written in the SQL query language similar to the PostgreSQL syntax.  Using SQLite in Electron is not possible in the renderer process, only in the main process. To communicate data operations between your main and your renderer processes, you have to use either @electron/remote (not recommended) or the ipcRenderer (recommended). So you start up SQLite in your main process and whenever you want to read or write data, you send the SQL queries to the main process and retrieve the result back as JSON data.  To install SQLite, use the SQLite3 package which is a native Node.js module. You also need the @electron/rebuild package to rebuild the SQLite module against the currently installed Electron version.  Install them with npm install sqlite3 @electron/rebuild. Then you can rebuild SQLite with ./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild -f -w sqlite3In the JavaScript code of your main process you can now create a database:  const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3'); const db = new sqlite3.Database('/path/to/database/file.db'); // create a table and insert a row db.serialize(() =&gt; { db.run(&quot;CREATE TABLE Users (name, lastName)&quot;); db.run(&quot;INSERT INTO Users VALUES (?, ?)&quot;, ['foo', 'bar']); });   Also you have to set up the ipcRenderer so that message from the renderer process are handled:  ipcMain.handle('db-query', async (event, sqlQuery) =&gt; { return new Promise(res =&gt; { db.all(sqlQuery, (err, rows) =&gt; { res(rows); }); }); });   In your renderer process, you can now call the ipcHandler and fetch data from SQLite:  const rows = await ipcRenderer.invoke('db-query', &quot;SELECT * FROM Users&quot;);   The downside of SQLite (or SQL in general) is that it is lacking many features that are handful when using a database together with UI based applications. It is not possible to observe queries or document fields and there is no replication method to sync data with a server. This makes SQLite a good solution when you just want to store data on the client or process expensive SQL queries on the server, but it is not suitable for more complex operations like two-way replication, encryption, compression and so on. Also developer helpers like TypeScript type safety are totally out of reach.

This ensures that search operations are performed quickly, even with large datasets. The search engine can handle multi-field queries, partial matching, and complex search operations, providing users with highly relevant results.  Local Data Indexing  With the plugin, all search operations are performed on the local data stored within the RxDB collections. This means that users can execute fulltext search queries without the need for an external server or database, which is especially beneficial for offline-first applications. The local indexing ensures that search queries are executed quickly, reducing the latency typically associated with remote database queries. Also when used in multiple browser tabs, it is ensured that through Leader Election, only exactly one tabs is doing the work of indexing without having an overhead in the other browser tabs.  Real-time Indexing  The plugin integrates seamlessly with RxDB's reactive nature. Every time a document is written to an RxCollection, an indexer updates the fulltext search index in real-time. This ensures that search results are always up-to-date, reflecting the most current state of the data without requiring manual reindexing.  Persistent indexing  The fulltext search index is efficiently persisted within the RxCollection, ensuring that the index remains intact across app restarts. When documents are added or updated in the collection, the index is incrementally updated in real-time, meaning only the changes are processed rather than reindexing the entire dataset. This incremental approach not only optimizes performance but also ensures that subsequent app launches are quick, as there's no need to reindex all the data from scratch, making the search feature both reliable and fast from the moment the app starts. When using an encrypted storage the index itself and incremental updates to it are stored fully encrypted and are only decrypted in-memory.  Complex Query Support  The FlexSearch-based plugin allows for sophisticated search queries, including multi-term and contextual searches. Users can perform complex searches that go beyond simple keyword matching, enabling more advanced use cases like searching for documents with specific phrases, relevance-based sorting, or even phonetic matching.  Offline-First Support and Privacy  As RxDB is designed with offline-first applications in mind, the fulltext search plugin supports this paradigm by ensuring that all search operations can be performed offline. This is crucial for applications that need to function in environments with intermittent or no internet connectivity, offering users a consistent and reliable search experience with zero latency.

The FoundationDB storage connects to a FoundationDB cluster which itself is just a distributed key-value engine. RxDB adds the NoSQL query-engine, indexes and other features on top of it. It scales horizontally because you can always add more servers to the FoundationDB cluster to increase the capacity. Setting up a RxDB database is pretty simple. You import the FoundationDB RxStorage and tell RxDB to use that when calling createRxDatabase:  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageFoundationDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-foundationdb'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'exampledb', storage: getRxStorageFoundationDB({ apiVersion: 620, clusterFile: '/path/to/fdb.cluster' }) }); // add a collection await db.addCollections({ users: { schema: mySchema } }); // run a query const result = await db.users.find({ selector: { name: 'foobar' } }).exec();   Another alternative storage is the SQLite RxStorage that stores the data inside of a SQLite filebased database. The SQLite storage is faster than FoundationDB and does not require to set up a cluster or anything because SQLite directly stores and reads the data inside of the filesystem. The downside of that is that it only scales vertically.  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageSQLite, getSQLiteBasicsNode } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-sqlite'; import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'; const myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'path/to/database/file/foobar.db', storage: getRxStorageSQLite({ sqliteBasics: getSQLiteBasicsNode(sqlite3) }) });   Because the SQLite RxStorage is not free and you might not want to set up a FoundationDB cluster, there is also the option to use the LokiJS RxStorage together with the filesystem adapter. This will store the data as plain json in a file and load everything into memory on startup. This works great for small prototypes but it is not recommended to be used in production.  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; const LokiFsStructuredAdapter = require('lokijs/src/loki-fs-structured-adapter.js'); import { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-lokijs'; import sqlite3 from 'sqlite3'; const myRxDatabase = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'path/to/database/file/foobar.db', storage: getRxStorageLoki({ adapter: new LokiFsStructuredAdapter() }) });   Here is a performance comparison chart of the different storages (lower is better):    ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"RxDB as Node.js In-Memory Database​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Node.js Database","url":"/nodejs-database.html#rxdb-as-nodejs-in-memory-database","content":" One of the easiest way to use RxDB in Node.js is to use the Memory RxStorage. As the name implies, it stores the data directly in-memory of the Node.js JavaScript process. This makes it really fast to read and write data but of course the data is not persisted and will be lost when the nodejs process exits. Often the in-memory option is used when RxDB is used in unit tests because it automatically cleans up everything afterwards.  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageMemory } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-memory'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'exampledb', storage: getRxStorageMemory() });   Also notice that the default memory limit of Node.js is 4gb (might change of newer versions) so for bigger datasets you might want to increase the limit with the max-old-space-size flag:  # increase the Node.js memory limit to 8GB node --max-old-space-size=8192 index.js   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Hybrid In-memory-persistence-synced storage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Node.js Database","url":"/nodejs-database.html#hybrid-in-memory-persistence-synced-storage","content":" If you want to have the performance of an in-memory database but require persistency of the data, you can use the memory-mapped storage.

In the following example the FoundationDB storage is used, but any other RxStorage can be used as persistence layer.  import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageFoundationDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-foundationdb'; import { getMemoryMappedRxStorage } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-memory-mapped'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'exampledb', storage: getMemoryMappedRxStorage({ storage: getRxStorageFoundationDB({ apiVersion: 620, clusterFile: '/path/to/fdb.cluster' }) }) });   While this approach gives you a database with great performance and persistent, it has two major downsides:  The database size is limited to the memory sizeWrites can be lost when the Node.js process exists between a write to the memory state and the background persisting.

But it was deprecated by the React Native Team which recommends to use a community based package instead. There is a community fork of AsyncStorage that is actively maintained and open source.  AsyncStorage is fine when only a small amount of data needs to be stored and when no query capabilities besides the key-access are required. Complex queries or features are not supported which makes AsyncStorage not suitable for anything more than storing simple user settings data.

Operations are written in the SQL query language and SQLite generally follows the PostgreSQL syntax.  To use SQLite in React Native, you first have to include the SQLite library itself as a plugin. There a different project out there that can be used, but I would recommend to use the react-native-quick-sqlite project.  First you have to install the library into your React Native project via npm install react-native-quick-sqlite. In your code you can then import the library and create a database connection:  import {open} from 'react-native-quick-sqlite'; const db = open('myDb.sqlite');   Notice that SQLite is a file based database where all data is stored directly in the filesystem of the OS. Therefore to create a connection, you have to provide a filename.  With the open connection you can then run SQL queries:  let { rows } = db.execute('SELECT somevalue FROM sometable');   If that does not work for you, you might want to try the react-native-sqlite-storage project instead which is also very popular.  Downsides of Using SQLite in UI-Based Apps​  While SQLite is reliable and well-tested, it has several shortcomings when it comes to using it directly in UI-based React Native applications:  Lack of Observability: Out of the box, SQLite does not offer a straightforward way to observe queries or document fields. This means that implementing real-time data updates in your UI requires additional layers or libraries.Bridging Overhead: Each query or data operation must go through the React Native bridge to access the native SQLite module. This can introduce performance bottlenecks or responsiveness issues, especially for large or complex data operations.No Built-In Replication: SQLite on its own is not designed for syncing data across multiple devices or with a backend. If your app requires multi-device data syncing or offline-first features, additional tools or a custom solution are necessary.Version Management: Handling schema changes often requires a custom migration process. If your data structure evolves frequently, managing these migrations can be cumbersome.  Overall, SQLite can be a good solution for straightforward, local-only data storage where complex real-time features or synchronization are not needed. For more advanced requirements, like reactive UI updates or multi-client data replication, you'll likely want a more feature-rich solution.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"PouchDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Native Database","url":"/react-native-database.html#pouchdb","content":"   PouchDB is a JavaScript NoSQL database that follows the API of the Apache CouchDB server database. The core feature of PouchDB is the ability to do a two-way replication with any CouchDB compliant endpoint. While PouchDB is pretty mature, it has some drawbacks that blocks it from being used in a client-side React Native application. For example it has to store all documents states over time which is required to replicate with CouchDB. Also it is not easily possible to fully purge documents and so it will fill up disc space over time. A big problem is also that PouchDB is not really maintained and major bugs like wrong query results are not fixed anymore. The performance of PouchDB is a general bottleneck which is caused by how it has to store and fetch documents while being compliant to CouchDB. The only real reason to use PouchDB in React Native, is when you want to replicate with a CouchDB or Couchbase server.  Because PouchDB is based on an adapter system for storage, there are two options to use it with React Native:  Either use the pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite adapteror the pouchdb-adapter-asyncstorage adapter.  Because the asyncstorage adapter is no longer maintained, it is recommended to use the native-sqlite adapter:  First you have to install the adapter and other dependencies via npm install pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite react-native-quick-sqlite react-native-quick-websql.  Then you have to craft a custom PouchDB class that combines these plugins:  import 'react-native-get-random-values'; import PouchDB from 'pouchdb-core'; import HttpPouch from 'pouchdb-adapter-http'; import replication from 'pouchdb-replication'; import mapreduce from 'pouchdb-mapreduce'; import SQLiteAdapterFactory from 'pouchdb-adapter-react-native-sqlite'; import WebSQLite from 'react-native-quick-websql'; const SQLiteAdapter = SQLiteAdapterFactory(WebSQLite); export default PouchDB.plugin(HttpPouch) .plugin(replication) .plugin(mapreduce) .plugin(SQLiteAdapter);   This can then be used to create a PouchDB database instance which can store and query documents:  const db = new PouchDB('mydb.db', { adapter: 'react-native-sqlite' });   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"RxDB​","type":1,"pageTitle":"React Native Database","url":"/react-native-database.html#rxdb","content":"   RxDB is an local-first, NoSQL-database for JavaScript applications.

This is great for UI-based realtime applications in a way that makes it easy to develop realtime applications like what you need in React Native.  Key benefits of RxDB include:  Observability and Real-Time Queries: Automatic UI updates when underlying data changes, making it much simpler to build responsive, reactive apps.Offline-First and Sync: Built-in support for syncing with CouchDB, or via GraphQL replication, allowing your app to work offline and seamlessly sync when online. It is easy to make the RxDB replication compatible with anything that supports HTTP.Encryption and Data Security: RxDB supports field-level encryption and a robust plugin ecosystem for compression and attachments.Data Modeling and Ease of Use: Offers a schema-based approach that helps catch invalid data early and ensures consistency.Performance: Optimized for storing and querying large amounts of data on mobile devices.  There are multiple ways to use RxDB in React Native:  Use the memory RxStorage that stores the data inside of the JavaScript memory without persistenceUse the SQLite RxStorage with the react-native-quick-sqlite plugin.  It is recommended to use the SQLite RxStorage because it has the best performance and is the easiest to set up. However it is part of the 👑 Premium Plugins which must be purchased, so to try out RxDB with React Native, you might want to use the memory storage first. Later you can replace it with the SQLite storage by just changing two lines of configuration.  First you have to install all dependencies via npm install rxdb rxjs rxdb-premium react-native-quick-sqlite. Then you can assemble the RxStorage and create a database with it:  1. Import RxDB and SQLite​ import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { open } from 'react-native-quick-sqlite'; RxDB Core RxDB Premium 👑 import { getRxStorageSQLiteTrial, getSQLiteBasicsCapacitor } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-sqlite'; 2.

Add a Collection​ const collections = await myRxDatabase.addCollections({ humans: { schema: { version: 0, type: 'object', primaryKey: 'id', properties: { id: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, name: { type: 'string' }, age: { type: 'number' } }, required: ['id', 'name'] } } }); 4. Insert a Document​ await collections.humans.insert({id: 'foo', name: 'bar'}); 5. Run a Query​ const result = await collections.humans.find({ selector: { name: 'bar' } }).exec(); 6. Observe a Query​ await collections.humans.find({ selector: { name: 'bar' } }).$.subscribe(result =&gt; {/* ... */});   Using the SQLite RxStorage is pretty fast, which is shown in the performance comparison.

In this tutorial we use the Cloud which is recommended for beginners because it is way easier to set up. You can later decide to self-host if needed.  1. Set up an Appwrite Endpoint and Project​ Self-Hosted Appwrite Instance Appwrite Cloud 1. Docker​ Ensure docker and docker-compose is installed and your version are up to date: docker-compose -v 2. Run the installation script​ The installation script runs inside of a docker container. It will create a docker-compose file and an .env file. docker run -it --rm \\ --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\ --volume &quot;$(pwd)&quot;/appwrite:/usr/src/code/appwrite:rw \\ --entrypoint=&quot;install&quot; \\ appwrite/appwrite:1.6.1 3. Start/Stop​ After the installation is done, you can manually stop and start the appwrite instance with docker compose: # stop docker-compose down # start docker-compose up 2. Create an Appwrite Database and Collection​ After creating an Appwrite project you have to create an Appwrite Database and a collection, you can either do this in code with the node-appwrite SDK or in the Appwrite Console as shown in this video: 9:47 Appwrite Database Tutorial 3. Add your documents attributes​ In the appwrite collection, create all attributes of your documents. You have to define all the fields that your document in your RxDB schema knows about. Notice that Appwrite does not allow for nested attributes. So when you use RxDB with Appwrite, you should also not have nested attributes in your RxDB schema. 4. Add a deleted attribute​ Appwrite (natively) hard-deletes documents. But for offline-handling RxDB needs soft-deleted documents on the server so that the deletion state can be replicated with other clients. In RxDB, _deleted indicates that a document is removed locally and you need a similar field in your Appwrite collection on the Server: You must define a deletedField with any name to mark documents as &quot;deleted&quot; in the remote collection. Mostly you would use a boolean field named deleted (set it to required). The plugin will treat any document with { [deletedField]: true } as deleted and replicate that state to local RxDB. 5. Set the Permission on the Appwrite Collection​ Appwrite uses permissions to control data access on the collection level. Make sure that in the Console at Collection -&gt; Settings -&gt; Permissions you have set the permission according to what you want to allow your clients to do. For testing, just enable all of them (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

Install the Client Dependencies​ In your JavaScript project, install the RxDB libraries and the MongoDB node.js driver: npm install rxdb rxdb-server mongodb --save 2. Set up a MongoDB Server​ As first step, you need access to a running MongoDB Server. This can be done by either running a server locally or using the Atlas Cloud. Notice that we need to have a replica set because only on these, the MongoDB changestream can be used. Shell Docker MongoDB Atlas If you have installed MongoDB locally, you can start the server with this command: mongod --replSet rs0 --bind_ip_all After this step you should have a valid connection string that points to a running MongoDB Server like mongodb://localhost:27017/. 3. Create a MongoDB Database and Collection​ On your MongoDB server, make sure to create a database and a collection. //&gt; server.ts import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'; const mongoClient = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/?directConnection=true'); const mongoDatabase = mongoClient.db('my-database'); await mongoDatabase.createCollection('my-collection', { changeStreamPreAndPostImages: { enabled: true } }); note To observe document deletions on the changestream, changeStreamPreAndPostImages must be enabled. This is not required if you have an insert/update-only collection where no documents are deleted ever. 4. Create a RxDB Database and Collection​ Now we create an RxDB database and a collection. In this example the memory storage, in production you would use a persistend storage instead. //&gt; server.ts import { createRxDatabase, addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageMemory } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-memory'; // Create server-side RxDB instance const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'serverdb', storage: getRxStorageMemory() }); // Add your collection schema await db.addCollections({ humans: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'passportId', type: 'object', properties: { passportId: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, firstName: { type: 'string' }, lastName: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['passportId', 'firstName', 'lastName'] } } }); 5. Sync the Collection with the MongoDB Server​ Now we can start a replication that does a two-way replication between the RxDB Collection and the MongoDB Collection. //&gt; server.ts import { replicateMongoDB } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-mongodb'; const replicationState = replicateMongoDB({ mongodb: { collectionName: 'my-collection', connection: 'mongodb://localhost:27017', databaseName: 'my-database' }, collection: db.humans, replicationIdentifier: 'humans-mongodb-sync', pull: { batchSize: 50 }, push: { batchSize: 50 }, live: true }); You can do many things with the replication state The RxMongoDBReplicationState which is returned from replicateMongoDB() allows you to run all functionality of the normal RxReplicationState like observing errors or doing start/stop operations. 6. Start a RxServer​ Now that we have a RxDatabase and Collection that is replicated with MongoDB, we can spawn a RxServer on top of it. This server can then be used by client devices to connect. //&gt; server.ts import { createRxServer } from 'rxdb-server/plugins/server'; import { RxServerAdapterExpress } from 'rxdb-server/plugins/adapter-express'; const server = await createRxServer({ database: db, adapter: RxServerAdapterExpress, port: 8080, cors: '*' }); const endpoint = server.addReplicationEndpoint({ name: 'humans', collection: db.humans }); console.log('Replication endpoint:', `http://localhost:8080/${endpoint.urlPath}`); // do not forget to start the server! await server.start(); 7. Sync a Client with the RxServer​ On the client-side we create the exact same RxDatabase and collection and then replicate it with the replication endpoint of the RxServer. //&gt; client.ts import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb'; import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie'; import { replicateServer } from 'rxdb-server/plugins/replication-server'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'mydb-client', storage: getRxStorageDexie() }); await db.addCollections({ humans: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'passportId', type: 'object', properties: { passportId: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, firstName: { type: 'string' }, lastName: { type: 'string' } }, required: ['passportId', 'firstName', 'lastName'] } } }); // Start replication to the RxServer endpoint printed by the server: // e.g. http://localhost:8080/humans/0 const replicationState = replicateServer({ replicationIdentifier: 'humans-rxserver', collection: db.humans, url: 'http://localhost:8080/humans/0', live: true, pull: { batchSize: 50 }, push: { batchSize: 50 } });   Beta The MongoDB Replication Plugin for RxDB is currently in beta.

Start a Node.js process with Express and MongoDB​ On the server side, we start an express server that has a MongoDB connection and serves the HTTP requests of the client. // &gt; server.ts import { MongoClient } from 'mongodb'; import express from 'express'; const mongoClient = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/'); const mongoConnection = await mongoClient.connect(); const mongoDatabase = mongoConnection.db('myDatabase'); const mongoCollection = await mongoDatabase.collection('myDocs'); const app = express(); app.use(express.json()); /* ... add routes from below */ app.listen(80, () =&gt; { console.log(`Example app listening on port 80`) }); 3. Implement the Pull Endpoint​ As first HTTP Endpoint, we need to implement the pull handler. This is used by the RxDB replication to fetch all documents writes that happened after a given checkpoint. The checkpoint format is not determined by RxDB, instead the server can use any type of changepoint that can be used to iterate across document writes. Here we will just use a unix timestamp updatedAt and a string id which is the most common used format. When the pull endpoint is called, the server responds with an array of document data based on the given checkpoint and a new checkpoint. Also the server has to respect the batchSize so that RxDB knows when there are no more new documents and the server returns a non-full array. // &gt; server.ts import { lastOfArray } from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; app.get('/pull', (req, res) =&gt; { const id = req.query.id; const updatedAt = parseFloat(req.query.updatedAt); const documents = await mongoCollection.find({ $or: [ /** * Notice that we have to compare the updatedAt AND the id field * because the updateAt field is not unique and when two documents * have the same updateAt, we can still &quot;sort&quot; them by their id. */ { updateAt: { $gt: updatedAt } }, { updateAt: { $eq: updatedAt } id: { $gt: id } } ] }) .sort({updateAt: 1, id: 1}) .limit(parseInt(req.query.batchSize, 10)).toArray(); const newCheckpoint = documents.length === 0 ? { id, updatedAt } : { id: lastOfArray(documents).id, updatedAt: lastOfArray(documents).updatedAt }; res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); res.end(JSON.stringify({ documents, checkpoint: newCheckpoint })); }); 4. Implement the Pull Handler​ On the client we add the pull.handler to the replication setting. The handler request the correct server url and fetches the documents. // &gt; client.ts const replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({ /* ... */ pull: { async handler(checkpointOrNull, batchSize){ const updatedAt = checkpointOrNull ? checkpointOrNull.updatedAt : 0; const id = checkpointOrNull ? checkpointOrNull.id : ''; const response = await fetch( `https://localhost/pull?updatedAt=${updatedAt}&amp;id=${id}&amp;limit=${batchSize}` ); const data = await response.json(); return { documents: data.documents, checkpoint: data.checkpoint }; } } /* ... */ }); 5. Implement the Push Endpoint​ To send client side writes to the server, we have to implement the push.handler. It gets an array of change rows as input and has to return only the conflicting documents that did not have been written to the server. Each change row contains a newDocumentState and an optional assumedMasterState. For conflict detection, on the server we first have to detect if the assumedMasterState is correct for each row. If yes, we have to write the new document state to the database, otherwise we have to return the &quot;real&quot; master state in the conflict array. The server also creates an event that is emitted to the pullStream$ which is later used in the pull.stream$. // &gt; server.ts import { lastOfArray } from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; import { Subject } from 'rxjs'; // used in the pull.stream$ below let lastEventId = 0; const pullStream$ = new Subject(); app.get('/push', (req, res) =&gt; { const changeRows = req.body; const conflicts = []; const event = { id: lastEventId++, documents: [], checkpoint: null }; for(const changeRow of changeRows){ const realMasterState = mongoCollection.findOne({id: changeRow.newDocumentState.id}); if( realMasterState &amp;&amp; !changeRow.assumedMasterState || ( realMasterState &amp;&amp; changeRow.assumedMasterState &amp;&amp; /* * For simplicity we detect conflicts on the server by only compare the updateAt value. * In reality you might want to do a more complex check or do a deep-equal comparison. */ realMasterState.updatedAt !== changeRow.assumedMasterState.updatedAt ) ) { // we have a conflict conflicts.push(realMasterState); } else { // no conflict -&gt; write the document mongoCollection.updateOne( {id: changeRow.newDocumentState.id}, changeRow.newDocumentState ); event.documents.push(changeRow.newDocumentState); event.checkpoint = { id: changeRow.newDocumentState.id, updatedAt: changeRow.newDocumentState.updatedAt }; } } if(event.documents.length &gt; 0){ myPullStream$.next(event); } res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json'); res.end(JSON.stringify(conflicts)); }); note For simplicity in this tutorial, we do not use transactions. In reality you should run the full push function inside of a MongoDB transaction to ensure that no other process can mix up the document state while the writes are processed. Also you should call batch operations on MongoDB instead of running the operations for each change row. 6. Implement the Push Handler​ With the push endpoint in place, we can add a push.handler to the replication settings on the client. // &gt; client.ts const replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({ /* ... */ push: { async handler(changeRows){ const rawResponse = await fetch('https://localhost/push', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, body: JSON.stringify(changeRows) }); const conflictsArray = await rawResponse.json(); return conflictsArray; } } /* ... */ }); 7. Implement the pullStream$ Endpoint​ While the normal pull handler is used when the replication is in iteration mode, we also need a stream of ongoing changes when the replication is in event observation mode. This brings the realtime replication to RxDB where changes on the server or on a client will directly get propagated to the other instances. On the server we have to implement the pullStream route and emit the events. We use the pullStream$ observable from above to fetch all ongoing events and respond them to the client. Here we use Server-End-Events which is the most common used way to stream data from the server to the client. Other method also exist like WebSockets or Long-Polling. // &gt; server.ts app.get('/pullStream', (req, res) =&gt; { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache' }); const subscription = pullStream$.subscribe(event =&gt; { res.write('data: ' + JSON.stringify(event) + '\\n\\n'); }); req.on('close', () =&gt; subscription.unsubscribe()); }); note How the build the pullStream$ Observable is not part of this tutorial. This heavily depends on your backend and infrastructure. Likely you have to observe the MongoDB event stream. 8. Implement the pullStream$ Handler​ From the client we can observe this endpoint and create a pull.stream$ observable that emits all events that are send from the server to the client. The client connects to an url and receives server-sent-events that contain all ongoing writes. // &gt; client.ts import { Subject } from 'rxjs'; const myPullStream$ = new Subject(); const eventSource = new EventSource( 'http://localhost/pullStream', { withCredentials: true } ); eventSource.onmessage = event =&gt; { const eventData = JSON.parse(event.data); myPullStream$.next({ documents: eventData.documents, checkpoint: eventData.checkpoint }); }; const replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({ /* ... */ pull: { /* ... */ stream$: myPullStream$.asObservable() } /* ... */ }); 9. pullStream$ RESYNC flag​ In case the client looses the connection, the EventSource will automatically reconnect but there might have been some changes that have been missed out in the meantime. The replication has to be informed that it might have missed events by emitting a RESYNC flag from the pull.stream$. The replication will then catch up by switching to the iteration mode until it is in sync with the server again. // &gt; client.ts eventSource.onerror = () =&gt; myPullStream$.next('RESYNC'); The purpose of the RESYNC flag is to tell the client that &quot;something might have changed&quot; and then the client can react on that information without having to run operations in an interval. If your backend is not capable of emitting the actual documents and checkpoint in the pull stream, you could just map all events to the RESYNC flag. This would make the replication work with a slight performance drawback: // &gt; client.ts import { Subject } from 'rxjs'; const myPullStream$ = new Subject(); const eventSource = new EventSource( 'http://localhost/pullStream', { withCredentials: true } ); eventSource.onmessage = () =&gt; myPullStream$.next('RESYNC'); const replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({ pull: { stream$: myPullStream$.asObservable() } });   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Missing implementation details​","type":1,"pageTitle":"HTTP Replication from a custom server to RxDB clients","url":"/replication-http.html#missing-implementation-details","content":" In this tutorial we only covered the basics of doing a HTTP replication between RxDB clients and a server.

Also for being able to stream all ongoing events, we need a Subscription called streamHuman.  input HumanInput { id: ID!, name: String!, lastName: String!, updatedAt: Float!, deleted: Boolean! } type Human { id: ID!, name: String!, lastName: String!, updatedAt: Float!, deleted: Boolean! } input Checkpoint { id: String!, updatedAt: Float! } type HumanPullBulk { documents: [Human]! checkpoint: Checkpoint } type Query { pullHuman(checkpoint: Checkpoint, limit: Int!): HumanPullBulk! } input HumanInputPushRow { assumedMasterState: HeroInputPushRowT0AssumedMasterStateT0 newDocumentState: HeroInputPushRowT0NewDocumentStateT0! } type Mutation { # Returns a list of all conflicts # If no document write caused a conflict, return an empty list. pushHuman(rows: [HumanInputPushRow!]): [Human] } # headers are used to authenticate the subscriptions # over websockets. input Headers { AUTH_TOKEN: String!; } type Subscription { streamHuman(headers: Headers): HumanPullBulk! }   The GraphQL resolver for the pullHuman would then look like:  const rootValue = { pullHuman: args =&gt; { const minId = args.checkpoint ? args.checkpoint.id : ''; const minUpdatedAt = args.checkpoint ? args.checkpoint.updatedAt : 0; // sorted by updatedAt first and the id as second const sortedDocuments = documents.sort((a, b) =&gt; { if (a.updatedAt &gt; b.updatedAt) return 1; if (a.updatedAt &lt; b.updatedAt) return -1; if (a.updatedAt === b.updatedAt) { if (a.id &gt; b.id) return 1; if (a.id &lt; b.id) return -1; else return 0; } }); // only return documents newer than the input document const filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId = sortedDocuments.filter(doc =&gt; { if (doc.updatedAt &lt; minUpdatedAt) return false; if (doc.updatedAt &gt; minUpdatedAt) return true; if (doc.updatedAt === minUpdatedAt) { // if updatedAt is equal, compare by id if (doc.id &gt; minId) return true; else return false; } }); // only return some documents in one batch const limitedDocs = filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId.slice(0, args.limit); // use the last document for the checkpoint const lastDoc = limitedDocs[limitedDocs.length - 1]; const retCheckpoint = { id: lastDoc.id, updatedAt: lastDoc.updatedAt } return { documents: limitedDocs, checkpoint: retCheckpoint } return limited; } }   For examples for the other resolvers, consult the GraphQL Example Project.

This is a function that gets the last replication checkpoint and a limit as input and returns an object with a GraphQL-query and its variables (or a promise that resolves to the same object). RxDB will use the query builder to construct what is later sent to the GraphQL endpoint.  const pullQueryBuilder = (checkpoint, limit) =&gt; { /** * The first pull does not have a checkpoint * so we fill it up with defaults */ if (!checkpoint) { checkpoint = { id: '', updatedAt: 0 }; } const query = `query PullHuman($checkpoint: CheckpointInput, $limit: Int!) { pullHuman(checkpoint: $checkpoint, limit: $limit) { documents { id name age updatedAt deleted } checkpoint { id updatedAt } } }`; return { query, operationName: 'PullHuman', variables: { checkpoint, limit } }; };   With the queryBuilder, you can then setup the pull-replication.  import { replicateGraphQL } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-graphql'; const replicationState = replicateGraphQL( { collection: myRxCollection, // urls to the GraphQL endpoints url: { http: 'http://example.com/graphql' }, pull: { queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above modifier: doc =&gt; doc, // (optional) modifies all pulled documents before they are handled by RxDB dataPath: undefined, // (optional) specifies the object path to access the document(s).

Install Dependencies​ npm install rxdb @supabase/supabase-js 2. Create a Supabase Project &amp; Table​ In your supabase project, create a new table. Ensure that: The primary key must have the type text (Primary keys must always be strings in RxDB)You have an modified field which stores the last modification timestamp of a row (default is _modified)You have a boolean field which stores if a row should is &quot;deleted&quot;. You should not hard-delete rows in Supabase, because clients would miss the deletion if they haven't been online at the deletion time. Instead, use a deleted boolean to mark rows as deleted. This way all clients can still pull the deletion, and RxDB will hide the complexity on the client side.Enable the realtime observation of writes to the table. Here is an example for a &quot;human&quot; table: create extension if not exists moddatetime schema extensions; create table &quot;public&quot;.&quot;humans&quot; ( &quot;passportId&quot; text primary key, &quot;firstName&quot; text not null, &quot;lastName&quot; text not null, &quot;age&quot; integer, &quot;_deleted&quot; boolean DEFAULT false NOT NULL, &quot;_modified&quot; timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL ); -- auto-update the _modified timestamp CREATE TRIGGER update_modified_datetime BEFORE UPDATE ON public.humans FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION extensions.moddatetime('_modified'); -- add a table to the publication so we can subscribe to changes alter publication supabase_realtime add table &quot;public&quot;.&quot;humans&quot;; 3. Create an RxDB Database &amp; Collection​ Create a normal RxDB database, then add a collection whose schema mirrors your Supabase table. The primary key must match (same column name and type), and fields should be top-level simple types (string/number/boolean). You don’t need to model server internals: the plugin maps the server’s _deleted flag to doc._deleted automatically, and _modified is optional in your schema (the plugin strips it on push and will include it on pull only if you define it). For browsers use a persistent storage like Localstorage or IndexedDB. For tests you can use the in-memory storage. // client import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; import { getRxStorageLocalstorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-localstorage'; export const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'mydb', storage: getRxStorageLocalstorage() }); await db.addCollections({ humans: { schema: { version: 0, primaryKey: 'passportId', type: 'object', properties: { passportId: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, firstName: { type: 'string' }, lastName: { type: 'string' }, age: { type: 'number' } }, required: ['passportId', 'firstName', 'lastName'] } } }); 4. Create the Supabase Client​ Make a single Supabase client and reuse it across your app. In the browser, use the anon key (RLS-protected). On trusted servers you may use the service role key—but never ship that to clients. Production Vite Local Development //&gt; client import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'; export const supabase = createClient( 'https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'eyJhbGciOi...' ); 5. Start Replication​ Connect your RxDB collection to the Supabase table to start the replication. //&gt; client import { replicateSupabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-supabase'; const replication = replicateSupabase({ tableName: 'humans', client: supabase, collection: db.humans, replicationIdentifier: 'humans-supabase', live: true, pull: { batchSize: 50, // optional: shape incoming docs modifier: (doc) =&gt; { // map nullable age-field if (!doc.age) delete doc.age; return doc; } }, push: { batchSize: 50 }, // optional overrides if your column names differ: // modifiedField: '_modified', // deletedField: '_deleted' }); // (optional) observe errors and wait for the first sync barrier replication.error$.subscribe(err =&gt; console.error('[replication]', err)); await replication.awaitInitialReplication(); Nullable values must be mapped Supabase returns null for nullable columns, but in RxDB you often model those fields as optional (i.e., they can be undefined/missing). To avoid schema errors, map null → undefined in the pull.modifier (usually by deleting the key). 6. Do other things with the replication state​ The RxSupabaseReplicationState which is returned from replicateSupabase() allows you to run all functionality of the normal RxReplicationState.  Beta The Supabase Replication Plugin for RxDB is currently in beta. While it is production-capable, the API and internal behavior may change before the stable release.

Here we build a todo-app that replicates todo-entries between clients:    You can find a fully build example of this at the RxDB Quickstart Repository which you can also try out online.  Four you create the database and then you can configure the replication:  1. Create the Database and Collection​ Here we create a database with the localstorage based storage that stores data inside of the LocalStorage API in a browser. RxDB has a wide range of storages for other JavaScript runtimes. import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; import { getRxStorageLocalstorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/storage-localstorage'; const db = await createRxDatabase({ name: 'myTodoDB', storage: getRxStorageLocalstorage() }); await db.addCollections({ todos: { schema: { title: 'todo schema', version: 0, type: 'object', primaryKey: 'id', properties: { id: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 }, title: { type: 'string' }, done: { type: 'boolean', default: false }, created: { type: 'string', format: 'date-time' } }, required: ['id', 'title', 'done'] } } }); // insert an example document await db.todos.insert({ id: 'todo-1', title: 'P2P demo task', done: false, created: new Date().toISOString() }); 2. Import the WebRTC replication plugin​ import { replicateWebRTC, getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-webrtc'; 3. Start the P2P replication​ To start the replication you have to call replicateWebRTC on the collection. As options you have to provide a topic and a connection handler function that implements the P2PConnectionHandlerCreator interface. As default you should start with the getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer method which uses the simple-peer library and comes shipped with RxDB. const replicationPool = await replicateWebRTC( { // Start the replication for a single collection collection: db.todos, // The topic is like a 'room-name'. All clients with the same topic // will replicate with each other. In most cases you want to use // a different topic string per user. Also you should prefix the topic with // a unique identifier for your app, to ensure you do not let your users connect // with other apps that also use the RxDB P2P Replication. topic: 'my-users-pool', /** * You need a collection handler to be able to create WebRTC connections. * Here we use the simple peer handler which uses the 'simple-peer' npm library. * To learn how to create a custom connection handler, read the source code, * it is pretty simple. */ connectionHandlerCreator: getConnectionHandlerSimplePeer({ // Set the signaling server url. // You can use the server provided by RxDB for tryouts, // but in production you should use your own server instead. signalingServerUrl: 'wss://signaling.rxdb.info/', // only in Node.js, we need the wrtc library // because Node.js does not contain the WebRTC API. wrtc: require('node-datachannel/polyfill'), // only in Node.js, we need the WebSocket library // because Node.js does not contain the WebSocket API. webSocketConstructor: require('ws').WebSocket }), pull: {}, push: {} } ); Notice that in difference to the other replication plugins, the WebRTC replication returns a replicationPool instead of a single RxReplicationState. The replicationPool contains all replication states of the connected peers in the P2P network. 4. Observe Errors​ To ensure we log out potential errors, observe the error$ observable of the pool. replicationPool.error$.subscribe(err =&gt; console.error('WebRTC Error:', err)); 5.

You only have to understand how three simple endpoints work.Complex Parts are in RxDB, not in the Backend: The complex parts of the Sync Engine, like conflict handling or offline-online switches, are implemented inside of RxDB itself. This makes creating a compatible backend very easy.Compatible with any Backend: Because the complex parts are in RxDB, the backend can be &quot;dump&quot; which makes the protocol compatible to almost every backend. No matter if you use PostgreSQL, MongoDB or anything else.Performance is optimized for Client Devices and Browsers: By grouping updates and fetches into batches, it is faster to transfer and easier to compress. Client devices and browsers can also process this data faster, for example running JSON.parse() on a chunk of data is faster than calling it once per row. Same goes for how client side storage like IndexedDB or OPFS works where writing data in bulks is faster.Offline-First Support: By incorporating conflict handling at the client side, the protocol fully supports offline-first apps. Users can continue making changes while offline, and those updates will sync seamlessly once a connection is reestablished - all without risking data loss or having undefined behavior.Multi-Tab Support: When RxDB is used in a browser and multiple tabs of the same application are opened, only exactly one runs the replication at any given time.

This is most often ensured by using the primaryKey as second sort parameter as part of the checkpoint. documents are never deleted, instead the _deleted field is set to true. This is needed so that the deletion state of a document exists in the database and can be replicated with other instances. If your backend uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you have to transform the data in the push/pull handlers or with the modifiers.  For example if your documents look like this:  const docData = { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;foobar&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Wilson&quot;, /** * Contains the last write timestamp * so all documents writes can be sorted by that value * when they are fetched from the remote instance. */ &quot;updatedAt&quot;: 1564483474, /** * Instead of physically deleting documents, * a deleted document gets replicated. */ &quot;_deleted&quot;: false }   Then your data is always sortable by updatedAt. This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes via pullHandler(), it can send the latest updatedAt+id checkpoint to the remote endpoint and then receive all newer documents.  By default, the field is _deleted. If your remote endpoint uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you can set the deletedField in the replication options which will automatically map the field on all pull and push requests.

When the player enters a particular chunk (say chunk-123), you start a replication dedicated to that chunk. On the server side, you have endpoints to pull only that chunk's voxels (e.g., GET /api/voxels/pull?chunkId=123) and push local changes back (e.g., POST /api/voxels/push?chunkId=123). RxDB handles them similarly to any other offline-first setup, but each replication is filtered to only that chunk's data.

With RxDB you can only store plain JSON data inside of a document. You cannot store a JavaScript new Date() instance directly. This is for performance reasons and because Date() is a mutable thing where changing it at any time might cause strange problem that are hard to debug. To store a date in RxDB, you have to define a string field with a format attribute: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;format&quot;: &quot;date-time&quot; } When storing the data you have to first transform your Date object into a string Date.toISOString(). Because the date-time is sortable, you can do whatever query operations on that field and even use it as an index.  How to store schemaless data? By design, RxDB requires that every collection has a schema. This means you cannot create a truly &quot;schema-less&quot; collection where top-level fields are unknown at schema creation time. RxDB must know about all fields of a document at the top level to perform validation, index creation, and other internal optimizations. However, there is a way to store data of arbitrary structure at sub-fields. To do this, define a property with type: &quot;object&quot; in your schema. For example: { &quot;version&quot;: 0, &quot;primaryKey&quot;: &quot;id&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot;, &quot;properties&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;, &quot;maxLength&quot;: 100 }, &quot;myDynamicData&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;object&quot; // Here you can store any JSON data // because it's an open object. } }, &quot;required&quot;: [&quot;id&quot;] }   Why does RxDB automatically set additionalProperties: false at the top level RxDB automatically sets additionalProperties: false at the top level of a schema to ensure that all top-level fields are known in advance. This design choice offers several benefits: Prevents collisions with RxDocument class properties: RxDB documents have built-in class methods (e.g., .toJSON, .save) at the top level. By forbidding unknown top-level properties, we avoid accidental naming collisions with these built-in methods. Avoids conflicts with user-defined ORM functions: Developers can add custom ORM methods to RxDocuments. If top-level properties were unbounded, a property name could accidentally conflict with a method name, leading to unexpected behavior. Improves TypeScript typings: If RxDB didn't know about all top-level fields, the document type would effectively become any. That means a simple typo like myDocument.toJOSN() would only be caught at runtime, not at build time. By disallowing unknown properties, TypeScript can provide strict typing and catch errors sooner.  Can't change the schema of a collection When you make changes to the schema of a collection, you sometimes can get an error likeError: addCollections(): another instance created this collection with a different schema. This means you have created a collection before and added document-data to it. When you now just change the schema, it is likely that the new schema does not match the saved documents inside of the collection. This would cause strange bugs and would be hard to debug, so RxDB check's if your schema has changed and throws an error. To change the schema in production-mode, do the following steps: Increase the version by 1Add the appropriate migrationStrategies so the saved data will be modified to match the new schema In development-mode, the schema-change can be simplified by one of these strategies: Use the memory-storage so your db resets on restart and your schema is not saved permanentlyCall removeRxDatabase('mydatabasename', RxStorage); before creating a new RxDatabase-instanceAdd a timestamp as suffix to the database-name to create a new one each run like name: 'heroesDB' + new Date().getTime() ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"RxState - Reactive Persistent State with RxDB","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/rx-state.html","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Creating a RxState​","type":1,"pageTitle":"RxState - Reactive Persistent State with RxDB","url":"/rx-state.html#creating-a-rxstate","content":" A RxState instance is created on top of a RxDatabase.

","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"FAQ​","type":1,"pageTitle":"RxQuery","url":"/rx-query.html#faq","content":" Can I specify which document fields are returned by an RxDB query? No, RxDB does not support partial document retrieval. Because RxDB is a client-side database with limited memory, it caches and de-duplicates entire documents across multiple queries. Even if you only need a few fields, most storages must still fetch the entire JSON data, so subselecting fields would not significantly improve performance. Therefore, RxDB always returns full documents. If you only need certain fields, you can filter them out in your application code or consider storing just the necessary data in a separate collection.  Why doesn't RxDB support aggregations on queries? RxDB runs entirely on the client side. Any &quot;aggregation&quot; or data processing you might do within RxDB would still happen in the same JavaScript environment as your application code. Therefore, there's no real performance advantage or difference between doing the aggregation in RxDB vs. doing it in your own code after fetching the data. As a result, RxDB doesn't provide built-in aggregation methods. Instead, just query the documents you need and perform any calculations directly in your app's code.  Why does RxDB not support cross-collection queries? RxDB is a client-side database and does not provide built-in cross-collection queries or transactions. Instead, you can execute multiple queries in your JavaScript code and combine their results as needed. Because everything runs in the same environment, this approach offers the same performance you would get if cross-collection queries were built in - without the added complexity.  Why Doesn't RxDB Support Case-Insensitive Search? RxDB relies on various storage engines as its backend, and these storage engines generally do not support case-insensitive search natively, like IndexedDB or FoundationDB. This limitation arises from the design of these engines, which prioritize efficiency and flexibility for specific types of queries rather than universal features like case-insensitivity. Although RxDB does not offer built-in support for case-insensitive search, there are two common workarounds: Store Data in a Meta-Field for Lowercase Search: To enable case-insensitive search, you can store an additional field in your documents where the relevant text data is preprocessed and saved in lowercase. const document = { name: 'John Doe', nameLowercase: 'john doe' // Meta-field }; await myCollection.insert(document); const query = myCollection.find({ selector: { nameLowercase: { $eq: 'john doe' } } }); Use a Regex Query: Regular expressions can perform case-insensitive searches. For example: const query = myCollection.find({ selector: { name: { $regex: '^john doe$', $options: 'i' } // Case-insensitive regex } }); However, this method has a significant downside: regex queries often cannot leverage indexes efficiently. As a result, they may be slower, especially for large datasets.

Reduce vendor lock-in: RxDB has a swappable storage layer which allows you to swap out the underlying storage of your database. If you ever decide to move away from DenoDeploy or Deno at all, you do not have to refactor your whole application and instead just swap the storage plugin. For example if you decide migrate to Node.js, you can use the FoundationDB RxStorage and store your data there. DenoKV is also implemented on top of FoundationDB so you can get similar performance. Alternatively RxDB supports a wide range of storage plugins you can decide from. Add reactiveness: DenoKV is a plain request-response datastore. While it supports observation of single rows by id, it does not allow to observe row-ranges or events. This makes it hard to impossible to build realtime applications with it because polling would be the only way to watch ranges of key-value pairs. With RxDB on top of DenoKV, changes to the database are shared between DenoDeploy instances so when you observe a query you can be sure that it is always up to date, no matter which instance has changed the document. Internally RxDB uses the Deno BroadcastChannel API to share events between instances. Reuse Client and Server Code: When you use RxDB on the server and on the client side, many parts of your code can be reused on both sides which decreases development time significantly. Replicate from DenoKV to a local RxDB state: Instead of running all operations against the global DenoKV, you can run a realtime-replication between a DenoKV-RxDatabase and a locally stored dataset or maybe even an in-memory stored one. This improves query performance and can reduce your Deno Deploy cloud costs because less operations run against the DenoKV, they only locally instead. Replicate with other backends: The RxDB Sync Engine is pretty simple and allows you to easily build a replication with any backend architecture. For example if you already have your data stored in a self-hosted MySQL server, you can use RxDB to do a realtime replication of that data into a DenoKV RxDatabase instance. RxDB also has many plugins for replication with backend/protocols like GraphQL, Websocket, CouchDB, WebRTC, Firestore and NATS.

Because there was no client-side database out there that fitted, I created RxDB as a wrapper around PouchDB. This worked great and all the PouchDB features like the query engine, the adapter system, CouchDB-replication and so on, came for free. But over the years, it became clear that PouchDB is not suitable for many applications, mostly because of its performance: To be compliant to CouchDB, PouchDB has to store all revision trees of documents which slows down queries. Also purging these document revisions is not possibleso the database storage size will only increase over time. Another problem was that many issues in PouchDB have never been fixed, but only closed by the issue-bot like this one. The whole PouchDB RxStorage code was full of workarounds and monkey patches to resolve these issues for RxDB users. Many these patches decreased performance even further. Sometimes it was not possible to fix things from the outside, for example queries with $gt operators return the wrong documents which is a no-go for a production database and hard to debug.  In version 10.0.0 RxDB introduced the RxStorage layer which allows users to swap out the underlying storage engine where RxDB stores and queries documents from. This allowed to use alternatives from PouchDB, for example the IndexedDB RxStorage in browsers or even the FoundationDB RxStorage on the server side. There where not many use cases left where it was a good choice to use the PouchDB RxStorage. Only replicating with a CouchDB server, was only possible with PouchDB. But this has also changed. RxDB has a plugin that allows to replicate clients with any CouchDB server by using the RxDB Sync Engine. This plugins work with any RxStorage so that it is not necessary to use the PouchDB storage. Removing PouchDB allows RxDB to add many awaited features like filtered change streams for easier replication and permission handling. It will also free up development time.  If you are currently using the PouchDB RxStorage, you have these options:  Migrate to another RxStorage (recommended)Never update RxDB to the next major version (stay on older 14.0.0)Fork the PouchDB RxStorage and maintain the plugin by yourself.Fix all the PouchDB problems so that we can add PouchDB to the RxDB Core again.

With an ACID transaction you can mutate data dependent on the current state of the database. It is ensured that no other database operations happen in between your transaction and after the transaction has finished, it is guaranteed that the new data is actually written to the disc.  To implement ACID transactions on a single server, the database has to keep track on who is running transactions and then schedule these transactions so that they can run in isolation.  As soon as you have to split your database on multiple servers, transaction handling becomes way more difficult. The servers have to communicate with each other to find a consensus about which transaction can run and which has to wait. Network connections might break, or one server might complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of an error on another server.  But with RxDB you have multiple clients that can go randomly online or offline. The users can have different devices and the clock of these devices can go off by any time. To support ACID transactions here, RxDB would have to make the whole world stand still for all clients, while one client is doing a write operation. And even that can only work when all clients are online. Implementing that might be possible, but at the cost of an unpredictable amount of performance loss and not being able to support offline-first.  A single write operation to a document is the only atomic thing you can do in RxDB.  The benefits of not having to support transactions:  Clients can read and write data without blocking each other.Clients can write data while being offline and then replicate with a server when they are online again, called offline-first.Creating a compatible backend for the replication is easy so that RxDB can replicate with any existing infrastructure.Optimizations like Sharding can be used.

Most client side databases rely on a last-write-wins strategy on write operations. This might be a viable solution for some cases, but often this leads to strange problems that are hard to debug.  Instead, to ensure that the behavior of RxDB is always predictable, RxDB relies on revisions for version control. Revisions work similar to Lamport Clocks.  Each document is stored together with its revision string, that looks like 1-9dcca3b8e1a and consists of:  The revision height, a number that starts with 1 and is increased with each write to that document.The database instance token.  An operation to the RxDB data layer does not only contain the new document data, but also the previous document data with its revision string. If the previous revision matches the revision that is currently stored in the database, the write operation can succeed.

When a local conflict appears, RxDB will throw a 409 CONFLICT error. The calling code must then handle the error properly, depending on the application logic.  Instead of handling local conflicts, in most cases it is easier to ensure that they cannot happen, by using incremental database operations like incrementalModify(), incrementalPatch() or incrementalUpsert().

To implement a fast batched cursor that only needs calls to getAll() and not to getAllKeys(), we first need to create an age index that contains the primary id as last field.  myIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex( 'age-index', [ 'age', 'id' ] );   This is required because the age field is not unique, and we need a way to checkpoint the last returned batch so we can continue from there in the next call to getAll().  const maxAge = 25; let result = []; const tx: IDBTransaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readonly', TRANSACTION_SETTINGS); const store = tx.objectStore(storeName); const index = store.index('age-index'); let lastDoc; let done = false; /** * Run the batched cursor until all results are retrieved * or the end of the index is reached. */ while (done === false) { await new Promise((res, rej) =&gt; { const range = IDBKeyRange.bound( /** * If we have a previous document as checkpoint, * we have to continue from it's age and id values. */ [ lastDoc ? lastDoc.age : -Infinity, lastDoc ? lastDoc.id : -Infinity, ], [ maxAge + 0.00000001, String.fromCharCode(65535) ], true, false ); const openCursorRequest = index.getAll(range, batchSize); openCursorRequest.onerror = err =&gt; rej(err); openCursorRequest.onsuccess = e =&gt; { const subResult: TestDocument[] = e.target.result; lastDoc = lastOfArray(subResult); if (subResult.length === 0) { done = true; } else { result = result.concat(subResult); } res(); }; }); } console.dir(result);     As the performance test results show, using a batched cursor can give a huge improvement. Interestingly choosing a high batch size is important. When you known that all results of a given IDBKeyRange are needed, you should not set a batch size at all and just directly query all documents via getAll().  RxDB uses batched cursors in the IndexedDB RxStorage.

Instead of storing all documents at one table/collection, the documents are split into so called shards and each shard is stored on one table/collection. This is done in server side architectures to spread the load between multiple physical servers which increases scalability.  When you use IndexedDB in a browser, there is of course no way to split the load between the client and other servers. But you can still benefit from sharding. Partitioning the documents horizontally into multiple IndexedDB stores, has shown to have a big performance improvement in write- and read operations while only increasing initial pageload slightly.    As shown in the performance test results, sharding should always be done by IDBObjectStore and not by database. Running a batched cursor over the whole dataset with 10 store shards in parallel is about 28% faster then running it over a single store. Initialization time increases minimal from 9 to 17 milliseconds. Getting a quarter of the dataset by batched iterating over an index, is even 43% faster with sharding then when a single store is queried.  As downside, getting 10k documents by their id is slower when it has to run over the shards. Also it can be much effort to recombined the results from the different shards into the required query result. When a query without a limit is done, the sharding method might cause a data load huge overhead.  Sharding can be used with RxDB with the Sharding Plugin.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Custom Indexes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Why IndexedDB is slow and what to use instead","url":"/slow-indexeddb.html#custom-indexes","content":" Indexes improve the query performance of IndexedDB significant. Instead of fetching all data from the storage when you search for a subset of it, you can iterate over the index and stop iterating when all relevant data has been found.  For example to query for all user documents that have an age greater than 25, you would create an age+id index. To be able to run a batched cursor over the index, we always need our primary key (id) as the last index field.  Instead of doing this, you can use a custom index which can improve the performance. The custom index runs over a helper field ageIdCustomIndex which is added to each document on write. Our index now only contains a single string field instead of two (age-number and id-string).  // On document insert add the ageIdCustomIndex field. const idMaxLength = 20; // must be known to craft a custom index docData.ageIdCustomIndex = docData.age + docData.id.padStart(idMaxLength, ' '); store.put(docData); // ...   // normal index myIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex( 'age-index', [ 'age', 'id' ] ); // custom index myIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex( 'age-index-custom', [ 'ageIdCustomIndex' ] );   To iterate over the index, you also use a custom crafted keyrange, depending on the last batched cursor checkpoint. Therefore the maxLength of id must be known.  // keyrange for normal index const range = IDBKeyRange.bound( [25, ''], [Infinity, Infinity], true, false ); // keyrange for custom index const range = IDBKeyRange.bound( // combine both values to a single string 25 + ''.padStart(idMaxLength, ' '), Infinity, true, false );     As shown, using a custom index can further improve the performance of running a batched cursor by about 10%.  Another big benefit of using custom indexes, is that you can also encode boolean values in them, which cannot be done with normal IndexedDB indexes.  RxDB uses custom indexes in the IndexedDB RxStorage.

One point is make persisting as fast as possible. LokiJS for example has the incremental-indexeddb-adapter which only saves new writes to the disc instead of persisting the whole state. Another point is to run the persisting at the correct point in time. For example the RxDB LokiJS storage persists in the following situations:  When the database is idle and no write or query is running. In that time we can persist the state if any new writes appeared before.When the window fires the beforeunload event we can assume that the JavaScript process is exited any moment and we have to persist the state.

But when you have all database state in memory and only periodically write it to disc, multiple browser tabs could overwrite each other and you would loose data. This might not be a problem when you rely on a client-server replication, because the lost data might already be replicated with the backend and therefore with the other tabs. But this would not work when the client is offline.  The ideal way to solve that problem, is to use a SharedWorker. A SharedWorker is like a WebWorker that runs its own JavaScript process only that the SharedWorker is shared between multiple contexts. You could create the database in the SharedWorker and then all browser tabs could request the Worker for data instead of having their own database. But unfortunately the SharedWorker API does not work in all browsers. Safari dropped its support and InternetExplorer or Android Chrome, never adopted it. Also it cannot be polyfilled. UPDATE:Apple added SharedWorkers back in Safari 142  Instead, we could use the BroadcastChannel API to communicate between tabs and then apply a leader election between them. The leader election ensures that, no matter how many tabs are open, always one tab is the Leader.    The disadvantage is that the leader election process takes some time on the initial page load (about 150 milliseconds). Also the leader election can break when a JavaScript process is fully blocked for a longer time. When this happens, a good way is to just reload the browser tab to restart the election process.

Some people think that they cannot do that with NoSQL, so let me explain.  Let's say you have two tables with customers and cities where each city has an id and each customer has a city_id. You want to get every customer that resides in Tokyo. With SQL, you would use a query like this:  SELECT * FROM city WHERE city.name = 'Tokyo' LEFT JOIN customer ON customer.city_id = city.id;   With NoSQL you can just do the same, but you have to write it manually:  const cityDocument = await db.cities.findOne().where('name').equals('Tokyo').exec(); const customerDocuments = await db.customers.find().where('city_id').equals(cityDocument.id).exec();   So what are the differences? The SQL version would run faster on a remote database server because it would aggregate all data there and return only the customers as result set. But when you have a local database, it is not really a difference. Querying the two tables by hand would have about the same performance as a JavaScript implementation of SQL that is running locally.  The main benefit from using SQL is, that the SQL query runs inside of a single transaction. When a change to one of our two tables happens, while our query runs, the SQL database will ensure that the write does not affect the result of the query. This could happen with NoSQL, while you retrieve the city document, the customer table gets changed and your result is not correct for the dataset that was there when you started the querying. As a workaround, you could observe the database for changes and if a change happened in between, you have to re-run everything.

The replication is reliable when, no matter what happens, every online client is able to run a replication and end up with the exact same database state as any other client.  Implementing a reliable replication protocol is hard because of the circumstances of your app:  Your users have unknown devices.They have an unknown internet speed.They can go offline or online at any time.Clients can be offline for a several days with un-synced changes.You can have many users at the same time.The users can do many database writes at the same time to the same entities.  Now lets say you have a SQL database and one of your users, called Alice, runs a query that mutates some rows, based on a condition.  # mark all items out of stock as inStock=FALSE UPDATE Table_A SET Table_A.inStock = FALSE FROM Table_A WHERE Table_A.amountInStock = 0   At first, the query runs on the local database of Alice and everything is fine.  But at the same time Bob, the other client, updates a row and sets amountInStock from 0 to 1. Now Bob's client replicates the changes from Alice and runs them. Bob will end up with a different database state than Alice because on one of the rows, the WHERE condition was not met. This is not what we want, so our replication protocol should be able to fix it. For that it has to reduce all mutations into a deterministic state.  Let me loosely describe how &quot;many&quot; SQL replications work:  Instead of just running all replicated queries, we remember a list of all past queries. When a new query comes in that happened before our last query, we roll back the previous queries, run the new query, and then re-execute our own queries on top of that. For that to work, all queries need a timestamp so we can order them correctly. But you cannot rely on the clock that is running at the client. Client side clocks drift, they can run in a different speed or even a malicious client modifies the clock on purpose. So instead of a normal timestamp, we have to use a Hybrid Logical Clock that takes a client generated id and the number of the clients query into account. Our timestamp will then look like 2021-10-04T15:29.40.273Z-0000-eede1195b7d94dd5. These timestamps can be brought into a deterministic order and each client can run the replicated queries in the same order. Watch this video to learn how to implement that.  While this sounds easy and realizable, we have some problems: This kind of replication works great when you replicate between multiple SQL servers. It does not work great when you replicate between a single server and many clients.  As mentioned above, clients can be offline for a long time which could require us to do many and heavy rollbacks on each client when someone comes back after a long time and replicates the change.We have many clients where many changes can appear and our database would have to roll back many times.During the rollback, the database cannot be used for read queries.It is required that each client downloads and keeps the whole query history.  With NoSQL, replication works different. A new client downloads all current documents and each time a document changes, that document is downloaded again. Instead of replicating the query that leads to a data change, we just replicate the changed data itself. Of course, we could do the same with SQL and just replicate the affected rows of a query, like WatermelonDB does it. This was a clever way to go for WatermelonDB, because it was initially made for React Native and did want to use the fast SQLite instead of the slow AsyncStorage. But in a more general view, it defeats the whole purpose of having a replicating relational database because you have transactions locally, but these transactions become meaningless as soon as the data goes through the replication layer.

Safely validating a SQL query is up to impossible.  You first need a way to parse the query with all this complex SQL syntax and keywords.You have to ensure that the query does not DOS your system.Then you check which rows would be affected when running the query and if the user was allowed to change themThen you check if the mutation to that rows are valid.

Similar to that you can optimize observable query results. When you query the customers table you get a query result of 10 customers. Now a new customer is added to the table and you want to know how the new query results look like. You could analyze the event and now you know that you only have to add the new customer to the previous results set, instead of running the whole query again. These types of optimizations can be run with all NoSQL queries and even work with limit and skip operators. In RxDB this all happens in the background with the EventReduce algorithm that calculates new query results on incoming changes.  These optimizations do not really work with relational data.
