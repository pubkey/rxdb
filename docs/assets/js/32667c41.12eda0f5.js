When database operations are executed in the main JavaScript thread, they can block or slow down the User Interface, especially during heavy or complex data operations.

This means the main thread remains free to handle user interactions and render updates without delay, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

These extensions often execute additional code or enforce extra checks with each operation, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. While they can provide valuable functionalities or custom behaviors, their overuse can inadvertently increase the complexity and execution time of basic database operations. By minimizing their use and only employing essential hooks and plugins, the system can operate more efficiently.
