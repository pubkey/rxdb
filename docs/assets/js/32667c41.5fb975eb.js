When database operations are executed in the main JavaScript thread, they can block or slow down the User Interface, especially during heavy or complex data operations. By offloading these operations to a WebWorker, you effectively separate the data processing workload from the UI thread. This means the main thread remains free to handle user interactions and render updates without delay, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience. Additionally, WebWorkers allow for parallel data processing, which can expedite tasks like querying and indexing.

These extensions often execute additional code or enforce extra checks with each operation, such as insertions, updates, or deletions. While they can provide valuable functionalities or custom behaviors, their overuse can inadvertently increase the complexity and execution time of basic database operations. By minimizing their use and only employing essential hooks and plugins, the system can operate more efficiently. This streamlined approach reduces the computational burden on each transaction, leading to faster response times and a more efficient overall data handling process, especially critical in high-load or real-time applications where performance is paramount."]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,a.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},8453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>i,x:()=>s});var r=t(6540);const a={},o=r.createContext(a);function i(e){const n=r.useContext(o);return r.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:i(e.components),r.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
