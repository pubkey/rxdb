When two RxDatabases have the same name and use the same RxStorage, their data can be assumed as equal and they will share events between each other.\nDepending on the storage or adapter this can also be used to define the filesystem folder of your data.\nstorage\nRxDB works on top of an implementation of the RxStorage interface. This interface is an abstraction that allows you to use different underlying databases that actually handle the documents. Depending on your use case you might use a different storage with different tradeoffs in performance, bundle size or supported runtimes.\nThere are many RxStorage implementations that can be used depending on the JavaScript environment and performance requirements.\nFor example you can use the PouchDB storage with an IndexedDB adapter in the browser. Or use the LokiJS storage with the filesystem adapter in Node.js.\n\nList of RxStorage implementations\n\n\n// use the PouchDB storage with indexeddb adapter...\nimport { getRxStoragePouch, addPouchPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-idb'));\n\nconst dbPouch = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb')\n});\n\n\n// ...or use the Dexie.js RxStorage that stores data in IndexedDB.\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/dexie';\n\nconst dbDexie = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n\n// ...or use the LokiJS RxStorage with the indexeddb adapter.\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/lokijs';\nconst LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter = require('lokijs/src/incremental-indexeddb-adapter');\n\nconst dbLoki = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'mydatabase',\n  storage: getRxStorageLoki({\n    adapter: new LokiIncrementalIndexedDBAdapter()\n  })\n});\n\npassword\n(optional)\nIf you want to use encrypted fields in the collections of a database, you have to set a password for it. The password must be a string with at least 12 characters.\nRead more about encryption here.\nmultiInstance\n(optional=true)\nWhen you create more than one instance of the same database in a single javascript-runtime, you should set multiInstance to true. This will enable the event sharing between the two instances. For example when the user has opened multiple browser windows, events will be shared between them so that both windows react to the same changes.\nmultiInstance should be set to false when you have single-instances like a single Node.js-process, a react-native-app, a cordova-app or a single-window electron app which can decrease the startup time because no instance coordination has to be done.\neventReduce\n(optional=true)\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously.

This is required for multiple reasons:\n\nIt allows us to run the validation inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows us to configure which RxDatabase instance must use the validation and which does not. In production it often makes sense to validate user data, but you might not need the validation for data that is only replicated from the backend.\n\nNOTICE: Schema validation can be CPU expensive and increases your build size.

For most use cases, you should not use a validation in production for better performance.\nWhen no validation is used, any document data can be saved but there might be undefined behavior when saving data that does not comply to the schema of a RxCollection.\nRxDB has different implementations to validate data, each of them is based on a different JSON Schema library.

Therefore it is not possible to run a count() query with a selector that requires to fetch and compare the document data. So if your query selector does not fully match an index of the schema, it is not allowed to run it. These queries would have no performance benefit compared to normal queries but have the tradeoff not not using the fetched document data for caching.\n/**\n * The following will throw an error because\n * the count operation cannot run on any specific index range\n * because the $regex operator is used.\n */\nconst query = myCollection.count({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n/**\n * The following will throw an error because\n * the count operation cannot run on any specific index range\n * because there is no ['age' ,'otherNumber'] index\n * defined in the schema.\n */\nconst query = myCollection.count({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $gt: 20\n    },\n    otherNumber: {\n      $gt: 10\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nIf you want to count these kind of queries, you should do a normal query instead and use the length of the result set as counter. This has the same performance as running a non-fully-indexed count which has to fetch all document data from the database and run a query matcher.\n// get count manually once\nconst resultSet = await myCollection.find({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n}).exec();\nconst count = resultSet.length;\n\n// observe count manually\nconst count$ = myCollection.find({\n  selector: {\n    age: {\n      $regex: 'foobar'\n    }\n  }\n}).$.pipe(\n  map(result => result.length)\n);\n\n/**\n * To allow non-fully-indexed count queries,\n * you can also specify that by setting allowSlowCount=true\n * when creating the database.\n */\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    allowSlowCount: true, // set this to true [default=false]\n    /* ... */\n});\n\nNOTICE: RxDB will always append the primary key to the sort parameters\nFor several performance optimizations, like the EventReduce algorithm, RxDB expects all queries to return a deterministic sort order that does not depend on the insert order of the documents. To ensure a deterministic ordering, RxDB will always append the primary key as last sort parameter to all queries and to all indexes.\nThis works in contrast to most other databases where a query without sorting would return the documents in the order in which they had been inserted to the database.\nNOTICE: RxQuery's are immutable\nBecause RxDB is a reactive database, we can do heavy performance-optimisation on query-results which change over time. To be able to do this, RxQuery's have to be immutable.\nThis means, when you have a RxQuery and run a .where() on it, the original RxQuery-Object is not changed. Instead the where-function returns a new RxQuery-Object with the changed where-field. Keep this in mind if you create RxQuery's and change them afterwards.\nExample:\nconst queryObject = myCollection.find().where('age').gt(18);\n// Creates a new RxQuery object, does not modify previous one\nqueryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObject.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are not sorted by name\n\nconst queryObjectSort = queryObject.sort('name');\nconst results = await queryObjectSort.exec();\nconsole.dir(results); // result-documents are now sorted\n\nisRxQuery\nReturns true if the given object is an instance of RxQuery.

To accomplish this, you change the schema and increase the version-number and you also change your code where you save the incoming messages. But one problem remains: what happens with the messages which are already saved on the user's device in the old schema?\nWith RxDB you can provide migrationStrategies for your collections that automatically (or on call) transform your existing data from older to newer schemas.

Count them, I will wait..\nSo if you would now inspect the traffic that these open tabs produce, you can see that many of them send exact the same data over wire for every tab. No matter if the data is sent with an open websocket or by polling.\nUse-case-example\nImagine we have a website which displays the current temperature of the visitors location in various charts, numbers or heatmaps. To always display the live-data, the website opens a websocket to our API-Server which sends the current temperature every 10 seconds. Using the way most sites are currently build, we can now open it in 5 browser-tabs and it will open 5 websockets which send data 6*5=30 times per minute. This will not only waste the power of your clients device, but also wastes your api-servers resources by opening redundant connections.\nSolution\nThe solution to this redundancy is the usage of a leader-election-algorithm which makes sure that always exactly one tab is managing the remote-data-access. The managing tab is the elected leader and stays leader until it is closed. No matter how many tabs are opened or closed, there must be always exactly one leader.\nYou could now start implementing a messaging-system between your browser-tabs, hand out which one is leader, solve conflicts and reassign a new leader when the old one 'dies'.\nOr just use RxDB which does all these things for you.\nAdd the leader election plugin\nTo enable the leader election, you have to add the leader-election plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBLeaderElectionPlugin);\n\nCode-example\nTo make it easy, here is an example where the temperature is pulled every ten seconds and saved to a collection. The pulling starts at the moment where the opened tab becomes the leader.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'weatherDB',\n  storage: getRxStoragePouch('idb'),\n  password: 'myPassword',\n  multiInstance: true\n});\nawait db.addCollections({\n  temperature: {\n    schema: mySchema\n  }\n});\n\ndb.waitForLeadership()\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log('Long lives the king!'); //  {\n      const temp = await fetch('https://example.com/api/temp/');\n      db.temperature.insert({\n          degrees: temp,\n          time: new Date().getTime()\n      });\n    }, 1000 * 10);\n  });\n\nHandle Duplicate Leaders\nOn rare occasions, it can happen that more then one leader is elected. This can happen when the CPU is on 100% or for any other reason the JavaScript process is fully blocked for a long time.\nFor most cases this is not really problem because on duplicate leaders, both browser tabs replicate with the same backend anyways.\nTo handle the duplicate leader event, you can access the leader elector and set a handler:\nimport {\n    getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/leader-election';\n\nconst leaderElector = getLeaderElectorByBroadcastChannel(broadcastChannel);\nleaderElector.onduplicate = async () => {\n    // Duplicate leader detected -> reload the page.\n    location.reload();\n}\n\nLive-Example\nIn this example the leader is marked with the crown ♛\n\nTry it out\nRun the vanillaJS-example where the leading tab is marked with a crown on the top-right-corner.\nNotice\nThe leader election is implemented via the  broadcast-channel module.\nThe leader is elected between different processes on the same javascript-runtime. Like multiple tabs in the same browser or multiple NodeJs-processes on the same machine. It will not run between different replicated instances.\n"},"rx-storage.html":{"url":"rx-storage.html","title":"RxStorage","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage\nRxDB is not a self contained database.

For Node.js, there are filesystem based adapters.\nImplementations\nPouchDB\nThe PouchDB RxStorage is based on the PouchDB database.

Read more\nWorker\nThe worker RxStorage is a wrapper around any other RxStorage which allows to run the storage in a WebWorker (in browsers) or a Worker Thread (in node.js). By doing so, you can take CPU load from the main process and move it into the worker's process which can improve the perceived performance of your application. Read more\nSharding\nOn some RxStorage implementations (like IndexedDB), a huge performance improvement can be done by sharding the documents into multiple database instances. With the sharding plugin you can wrap any other RxStorage into a sharded storage. Read more\nMemory Synced\nThe memory synced RxStorage is a wrapper around any other RxStorage. The wrapper creates an in-memory storage that is used for query and write operations. This memory instance is replicated with the underlying storage for persistence.\nThe main reason to use this is to improve initial page load and query/write times. This is mostly useful in browser based applications. Read more\nPerformance comparison\nA big difference in the RxStorage implementations is the performance. In difference to a server side database, RxDB is bound to the limits of the JavaScript runtime. For example in the browser it is only possible to store data in a slow IndexedDB instead of a filesystem.\nLokiJS stores all data in memory and only saves to disc occasionally (or on exit). Therefore it has a very fast read/write performance, but loading all data into memory on the first page load can take longer for big amounts of documents. Also this storage can only be used when all data fits into the memory at least once.\nThe Premium sharding RxStorage is only useful when big amounts of documents have to be stored or queries. In the CI performance test, we only insert a small amount of documents so that the performance actually decreases when sharding is used.\nThe PouchDB RxStorage is slow because it has to handle all revisions of a document on writes and queries. This makes PouchDB the only storage where it is possible to replicate with a CouchDB compatible endpoint.\nMany storages run lazy, so it makes no sense to compare the time which is required to create a database with collections. Instead we measure the time-to-first-insert which is the whole timespan from database creation until the first single document write is done.\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n"},"rx-storage-pouchdb.html":{"url":"rx-storage-pouchdb.html","title":"RxStorage PouchDB","keywords":"","body":"RxStorage PouchDB\nThe PouchDB RxStorage is based on the PouchDB database.

It can do this because it is an in-memory database that processes all data in memory and only saves to disc when the app is closed or an interval is reached.\nPros\n\nQueries can run faster because all data is processed in memory.\nIt has a much faster initial load time because it loads all data from IndexedDB in a single request. But this is only true for small datasets. If much data must is stored, the initial load time can be higher than on other RxStorage implementations.\n\nCons\n\nDoes not support CouchDB replication. \nIt does not support attachments.

For LokiJS there are adapters for IndexedDB, AWS S3, the NodeJS filesystem or NativeScript.\nFind more about the possible adapters at the LokiJS docs.\nMulti-Tab support\nWhen you use plain LokiJS, you cannot build an app that can be used in multiple browser tabs. The reason is that LokiJS loads data in bulk and then only regularly persists the in-memory state to disc. When opened in multiple tabs, it would happen that the LokiJS instances overwrite each other and data is lost.\nWith the RxDB LokiJS-plugin, this problem is fixed with the LeaderElection module. Between all open tabs, a leading tab is elected and only in this tab a database is created. All other tabs do not run queries against their own database, but instead call the leading tab to send and retrieve data. When the leading tab is closed, a new leader is elected that reopens the database and processes queries. You can disable this by setting multiInstance: false when creating the RxDatabase.\nAutosave and autoload\nWhen using plain LokiJS, you could set the autosave option to true to make sure that LokiJS persists the database state after each write into the persistence adapter. Same goes to autoload which loads the persisted state on database creation.\nBut RxDB knows better when to persist the database state and when to load it, so it has its own autosave logic. This will ensure that running the persistence handler does not affect the performance of more important tasks. Instead RxDB will always wait until the database is idle and then runs the persistence handler.\nA load of the persisted state is done on database or collection creation and it is ensured that multiple load calls do not run in parallel and interfere with each other or with saveDatabase() calls.\nKnown problems\nWhen you bundle the LokiJS Plugin with webpack, you might get the error Cannot find module \"fs\". This is because LokiJS uses a require('fs') statement that cannot work in the browser.\nYou can fix that by telling webpack to not resolve the fs module with the following block in your webpack config:\n// in your webpack.config.js\n{\n    /* ... */\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            fs: false\n        }\n    }\n    /* ... */\n}\n\n// Or if you do not have a webpack.config.js like you do with angular,\n// you might fix it by setting the browser field in the package.json\n{\n  /* ... */\n  \"browser\": {\n    \"fs\": false\n  }\n  /* ... */\n}\n\nUsing the internal LokiJS database\nFor custom operations, you can access the internal LokiJS database.\nThis is dangerous because you might do changes that are not compatible with RxDB.\nOnly use this when there is no way to achieve your goals via the RxDB API.\n\nconst storageInstance = myRxCollection.storageInstance;\nconst localState = await storageInstance.internals.localState;\nlocalState.collection.insert({\n    key: 'foo',\n    value: 'bar',\n    _deleted: false,\n    _attachments: {},\n    _rev: '1-62080c42d471e3d2625e49dcca3b8e3e',\n    _meta: {\n        lwt: new Date().getTime()\n    }\n});\n\n// manually trigger the save queue because we did a write to the internal loki db. \nawait localState.databaseState.saveQueue.addWrite();\n\n"},"rx-storage-memory.html":{"url":"rx-storage-memory.html","title":"RxStorage Memory","keywords":"","body":"Memory RxStorage\nThe Memory RxStorage is based on plain in memory arrays and objects.

Returns all documents that have been written after the given checkpoint. Also returns the checkpoint of the latest written returned document.\npushHandler a method that can be called by the client to send client side writes to the master. It gets an array with the the assumedMasterState and the newForkState of each document write as input. It must return an array that contains the master document states of all conflicts. If there are no conflicts, it must return an empty array.\npullStream an observable that emits batches of all master writes and the latest checkpoint of the write batches.\n\n        +--------+                             +--------+   \n        |        | pullHandler()               |        |\n        |        |--------------------->       |        |   \n        |        |                             |        | \n        |        |                             |        |  \n        | Client | pushHandler()               | Server |  \n        |        |--------------------->       |        | \n        |        |                             |        |\n        |        |   pullStream$               |        | \n        |        |   The replication runs in two different modes:\nCheckpoint iteration\nOn first initial replication, or when the client comes online again, a checkpoint based iteration is used to catch up with the server state.\nA checkpoint is a subset of the fields of the last pulled document. When the checkpoint is send to the backend via pullHandler(), the backend must be able to respond with all documents that have been written after the given checkpoint.\nFor example if your documents contain an id and an updatedAt field, these two can be used as checkpoint.\nWhen the checkpoint iteration reaches the last checkpoint, where the backend returns an empty array because there are no newer documents, the replication will automatically switch to the event observation mode.\nEvent observation\nWhile the client is connected to the backend, the events from the backend are observed via pullStream$ and persisted to the client.\nIf your backend for any reason is not able to provide a full pullStream$ that contains all events and the checkpoint, you can instead only emit RESYNC events that tell RxDB that anything unknown has changed on the server and it should run the pull replication via checkpoint iteration.\nWhen the client goes offline and online again, it might happen that the pullStream$ has missed out some events. Therefore the pullStream$ should also emit a RESYNC event each time the client reconnects, so that the client can become in sync with the backend via the checkpoint iteration mode.\nData layout on the server\nTo use the replication you first have to ensure that:\n\ndocuments are deterministic sortable by their last write time\ndeterministic means that even if two documents have the same last write time, they have a predictable sort order.\n  This is most often ensured by using the primaryKey as second sort parameter as part of the checkpoint.\n\ndocuments are never deleted, instead the _deleted field is set to true.\nThis is needed so that the deletion state of a document exists in the database and can be replicated with other instances. If your backend uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you have to transform the data in the push/pull handlers or with the modifiers.\n\n\nFor example if your documents look like this:\n{\n    \"id\": \"foobar\",\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"lastName\": \"Wilson\",\n    /**\n     * Contains the last write timestamp\n     * so all documents writes can be sorted by that value\n     * when they are fetched from the remote instance.\n     */\n    \"updatedAt\": 1564483474,\n    /**\n     * Instead of physically deleting documents,\n     * a deleted document gets replicated.\n     */\n    \"_deleted\": false\n}\n\nThen your data is always sortable by updatedAt. This ensures that when RxDB fetches 'new' changes via pullHandler(), it can send the latest updatedAt+id checkpoint to the remote endpoint and then receive all newer documents.\nBy default, the field is _deleted. If your remote endpoint uses a different field to mark deleted documents, you can set the deletedField in the replication options which will automatically map the field on all pull and push requests.\nConflict handling\nWhen multiple clients (or the server) modify the same document at the same time (or when they are offline), it can happen that a conflict arises during the replication.\nA---B1---C1---X    master/server state\n     \\       /\n      B1---C2      fork/client state\nIn the case above, the client would tell the master to move the document state from B1 to C2 by calling pushHandler(). But because the actual master state is C1 and not B1, the master would reject the write by sending back the actual master state C1. \nRxDB resolves all conflicts on the client so it would call the conflict handler of the RxCollection and create a new document state D that can then be written to the master.\nA---B1---C1---X---D    master/server state\n     \\       / \\ /\n      B1---C2---D      fork/client state\nThe default conflict handler will always drop the fork state and use the master state. This ensures that clients that are offline for a very long time, do not accidentally overwrite other peoples changes when they go online again.\nYou can specify a custom conflict handler by setting the property conflictHandler when calling addCollection().\nreplicateRxCollection()\nYou can start the replication of a single RxCollection by calling replicateRxCollection() like in the following:\nimport { replicateRxCollection } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication';\nimport {\n    lastOfArray\n} from 'rxdb';\nconst replicationState = await replicateRxCollection({\n    collection: myRxCollection,\n    /**\n     * An id for the replication to identify it\n     * and so that RxDB is able to resume the replication on app reload.\n     * If you replicate with a remote server, it is recommended to put the\n     * server url into the replicationIdentifier.\n     */\n    replicationIdentifier: 'my-rest-replication-to-https://example.com/api/sync',\n    /**\n     * By default it will do an ongoing realtime replication.\n     * By settings live: false the replication will run once until the local state\n     * is in sync with the remote state, then it will cancel itself.\n     * (optional), default is true.\n     */\n    live: true,\n    /**\n     * Time in milliseconds after when a failed backend request\n     * has to be retried.\n     * (optional), default is 5 seconds.\n     */\n    retryTime: 5 * 1000,\n    /**\n     * When multiInstance is true, like when you use RxDB in multiple browser tabs,\n     * the replication should always run in only one of the open browser tabs.\n     * If waitForLeadership is true, it will wait until the current instance is leader.\n     * If waitForLeadership is false, it will start replicating, even if it is not leader.\n     * [default=true]\n     */\n    waitForLeadership: true,\n    /**\n     * If this is set to false,\n     * the replication will not start automatically\n     * but will wait for replicationState.start() being called.\n     * (optional), default is true\n     */\n    autoStart: true,\n\n    /**\n     * Custom deleted field, the boolean property of the document data that\n     * marks a document as being deleted.\n     * If your backend uses a different fieldname then '_deleted', set the fieldname here.\n     * RxDB will still store the documents internally with '_deleted', setting this field\n     * only maps the data on the data layer.\n     * \n     * If a custom deleted field contains a non-boolean value, the deleted state\n     * of the documents depends on if the value is truthy or not.

RxDB always assumes that the backend is the single source of truth.\n\nError handling\nWhen sending a document to the remote fails for any reason, RxDB will send it again in a later point in time.\nThis happens for all errors. The document write could have already reached the remote instance and be processed, while only the answering fails.\nThe remote instance must be designed to handle this properly and to not crash on duplicate data transmissions. \nDepending on your use case, it might be ok to just write the duplicate document data again.\nBut for a more resilient error handling you could compare the last write timestamps or add a unique write id field to the document. This field can then be used to detect duplicates and ignore re-send data.\nAlso the replication has an .error$ stream that emits all RxError objects that arise during replication.\nNotice that these errors are contain an inner .parameters.errors field that contains the original error. Also they contain a .parameters.direction field that indicates if the error was thrown during pull or push. You can use these to properly handle errors. For example when the client is outdated, the server might respond with a 426 Upgrade Required error code that can then be used to force a page reload.\nreplicationState.error$.subscribe((error) => {\n    if(\n        error.parameters.errors &&\n        error.parameters.errors[0] &&\n        error.parameters.errors[0].code === 426\n    ) {\n        // client is outdated -> enforce a page reload\n        location.reload();\n    }\n});\n\nSecurity\nBe aware that client side clocks can never be trusted. When you have a client-backend replication, the backend should overwrite the updatedAt timestamp or use another field, when it receives the change from the client.\nRxReplicationState\nThe function replicateRxCollection() returns a RxReplicationState that can be used to manage and observe the replication.\nObservable\nTo observe the replication, the RxReplicationState has some Observable properties:\n// emits each document that was received from the remote\nmyRxReplicationState.received$.subscribe(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\n// emits each document that was send to the remote\nmyRxReplicationState.send$.subscribe(doc => console.dir(doc));\n\n// emits all errors that happen when running the push- & pull-handlers.\nmyRxReplicationState.error$.subscribe(error => console.dir(error));\n\n// emits true when the replication was canceled, false when not.\nmyRxReplicationState.canceled$.subscribe(bool => console.dir(bool));\n\n// emits true when a replication cycle is running, false when not.\nmyRxReplicationState.active$.subscribe(bool => console.dir(bool));\n\nawaitInitialReplication()\nWith awaitInitialReplication() you can await the initial replication that is done when a full replication cycle was finished for the first time.\nWARNING: When multiInstance: true and waitForLeadership: true and another tab is already running the replication, awaitInitialReplication() will not resolve until the other tab is closed and the replication starts in this tab.\nawait myRxReplicationState.awaitInitialReplication();\n\nawaitInSync()\nReturns a Promise that resolves when:\n\nawaitInitialReplication() has emitted.\nAll local data is replicated with the remote.\nNo replication cycle is running or in retry-state.\n\nWARNING: When multiInstance: true and waitForLeadership: true and another tab is already running the replication, awaitInSync() will not resolve until the other tab is closed and the replication starts in this tab.\nawait myRxReplicationState.awaitInSync();\n\nreSync()\nTriggers a RESYNC cycle where the replication goes into Checkpoint iteration until the client is in sync with the backend.

For example lets say you create a Query pullHuman which returns a list of document writes that happened after the given checkpoint.\nFor the push-replication, you also need a Mutation pushHuman which lets RxDB update data of documents by sending the previous document state and the new client document state.\nAlso for being able to stream all ongoing events, we need a Subscription called streamHuman.\ninput HumanInput {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ntype Human {\n    id: ID!,\n    name: String!,\n    lastName: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!,\n    deleted: Boolean!\n}\ninput Checkpoint {\n    id: String!,\n    updatedAt: Float!\n}\ntype HumanPullBulk {\n    documents: [Human]!\n    checkpoint: Checkpoint\n}\n\ntype Query {\n    pullHuman(checkpoint: Checkpoint, limit: Int!): HumanPullBulk!\n}\n\ninput HumanInputPushRow {\n    assumedMasterState: HeroInputPushRowT0AssumedMasterStateT0\n    newDocumentState: HeroInputPushRowT0NewDocumentStateT0!\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n    # Returns a list of all conflicts\n    # If no document write caused a conflict, return an empty list.\n    pushHuman(rows: [HumanInputPushRow!]): [Human]\n}\n\n# headers are used to authenticate the subscriptions\n# over websockets.\ninput Headers {\n    AUTH_TOKEN: String!;\n}\ntype Subscription {\n    streamHuman(headers: Headers): HumanPullBulk!\n}\n\nThe GraphQL resolver for the pullHuman would then look like:\nconst rootValue = {\n    pullHuman: args => {\n        const minId = args.checkpoint : args.checkpoint.id : '';\n        const minUpdatedAt = args.checkpoint : args.checkpoint.updatedAt : 0;\n\n        // sorted by updatedAt first and the id as second\n        const sortedDocuments = documents.sort((a, b) => {\n            if (a.updatedAt > b.updatedAt) return 1;\n            if (a.updatedAt  b.id) return 1;\n                if (a.id  {\n            if (doc.updatedAt  minUpdatedAt) return true;\n            if (doc.updatedAt === minUpdatedAt) {\n                // if updatedAt is equal, compare by id\n                if (doc.id > minId) return true;\n                else return false;\n            }\n        });\n\n        // only return some documents in one batch\n        const limitedDocs = filterForMinUpdatedAtAndId.slice(0, args.limit);\n\n        // use the last document for the checkpoint\n        const lastDoc = limitedDocs[limitedDocs.length - 1];\n        const retCheckpoint = {\n            id: lastDoc.id,\n            updatedAt: lastDoc.updatedAt\n        }\n\n        return {\n            documents: limitedDocs,\n            checkpoint: retCheckpoint\n        }\n\n        return limited;\n    }\n}\n\nFor examples for the other resolvers, consult the GraphQL Example Project.\nRxDB Client\nImport the plugin\nThe graphql-replication is not part of the default-build of RxDB. You have to import the plugin before you can use it.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/replication-graphql';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBReplicationGraphQLPlugin);\n\nPull replication\nFor the pull-replication, you first need a pullQueryBuilder. This is a function that gets the last replication checkpoint and a limit as input and returns an object with a GraphQL-query and its variables (or a promise that resolves to the same object). RxDB will use the query builder to construct what is later sent to the GraphQL endpoint.\nconst pullQueryBuilder = (checkpoint, limit) => {\n    /**\n     * The first pull does not have a checkpoint\n     * so we fill it up with defaults\n     */\n    if (!checkpoint) {\n        checkpoint = {\n            id: '',\n            updatedAt: 0\n        };\n    }\n    const query = `query PullHuman($checkpoint: CheckpointInput, $limit: Int!) {\n        pullHuman(checkpoint: $checkpoint, limit: $limit) {\n            documents {\n                id\n                name\n                age\n                updatedAt\n                deleted\n            }\n            checkpoint {\n                id\n                updatedAt\n            }\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {\n            checkpoint,\n            limit\n        }\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the pull-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n    url: {\n        http: 'http://example.com/graphql'\n    },\n    pull: {\n        queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        modifier: doc => doc, // (optional) modifies all pulled documents before they are handled by RxDB\n        dataPath: undefined, // (optional) specifies the object path to access the document(s). Otherwise, the first result of the response data is used.\n        /**\n         * Amount of documents that the remote will send in one request.\n         * If the response contains less then [batchSize] documents,\n         * RxDB will assume there are no more changes on the backend\n         * that are not replicated.\n         * This value is the same as the limit in the pullHuman() schema.\n         * [default=100]\n         */\n        batchSize: 50\n    },\n    // headers which will be used in http requests against the server.\n    headers: {\n        Authorization: 'Bearer abcde...'\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Options that have been inherited from the RxReplication\n     */\n    deletedField: 'deleted',\n    live: true,\n    retryTime = 1000 * 5,\n    waitForLeadership = true,\n    autoStart = true,\n});\n\nPush replication\nFor the push-replication, you also need a queryBuilder. Here, the builder receives a changed document as input which has to be send to the server. It also returns a GraphQL-Query and its data.\nconst pushQueryBuilder = rows => {\n    const query = `\n    mutation PushHuman($writeRows: [HumanInputPushRow!]) {\n        pushHuman(writeRows: $writeRows) {\n            id\n            name\n            age\n            updatedAt\n            deleted\n        }\n    }\n    `;\n    const variables = {\n        writeRows: rows\n    };\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables\n    };\n};\n\nWith the queryBuilder, you can then setup the push-replication.\nconst replicationState = myCollection.syncGraphQL({\n    // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n    url: {\n        http: 'http://example.com/graphql'\n    },\n    push: {\n        queryBuilder: pushQueryBuilder, // the queryBuilder from above\n        /**\n         * batchSize (optional)\n         * Amount of document that will be pushed to the server in a single request.\n         */\n        batchSize: 5,\n        /**\n         * modifier (optional)\n         * Modifies all pushed documents before they are send to the GraphQL endpoint.\n         * Returning null will skip the document.\n         */\n        modifier: doc => doc\n    },\n    headers: {\n        Authorization: 'Bearer abcde...'\n    },\n    pull: {\n        /* ... */\n    },\n    /* ... */\n});\n\nPull Stream\nTo create a realtime replication, you need to create a pull stream that pulls ongoing writes from the server.\nThe pull stream gets the headers of the RxReplicationState as input, so that it can be authenticated on the backend.\nconst pullStreamQueryBuilder = (headers) => {\n    const query = `subscription onStream($headers: Headers) {\n        streamHero(headers: $headers) {\n            documents {\n                id,\n                name,\n                age,\n                updatedAt,\n                deleted\n            },\n            checkpoint {\n                id\n                updatedAt\n            }\n        }\n    }`;\n    return {\n        query,\n        variables: {\n            headers\n        }\n    };\n};\n\nWith the pullStreamQueryBuilder you can then start a realtime replication.\nconst replicationState = c.syncGraphQL({\n    // urls to the GraphQL endpoints\n    url: {\n        http: 'http://example.com/graphql',\n        ws: 'ws://example.com/subscriptions' // \nNOTICE: If it is not possible to create a websocket server on your backend, you can use any other method of pull out the ongoing events from the backend and then you can send them into RxReplicationState.emitEvent().\nTransforming null to undefined in optional fields\nGraphQL fills up non-existent optional values with null while RxDB required them to be undefined.\nTherefore, if your schema contains optional properties, you have to transform the pulled data to switch out null to undefined\nconst replicationState: RxGraphQLReplicationState = collection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: {/* ... */},\n    headers: {/* ... */},\n    push: {/* ... */},\n    pull: {\n        queryBuilder: pullQueryBuilder,\n        modifier: (doc => {\n            //Wwe have to remove optional non-existend field values\n            // they are set as null by GraphQL but should be undefined\n            Object.entries(doc).forEach(([k, v]) => {\n                if (v === null) {\n                    delete doc[k];\n                }\n            });\n            return doc;\n        })\n    },\n    /* ... */\n});\n\npull.responseModifier\nWith the pull.responseModifier you can modify the whole response from the GraphQL endpoint before it is processed by RxDB.\nFor example if your endpoint is not capable of returning a valid checkpoint, but instead only returns the plain document array, you can use the responseModifier to aggregate the checkpoint from the returned documents.\nimport {\n\n} from 'rxdb';\nconst replicationState: RxGraphQLReplicationState = collection.syncGraphQL({\n    url: {/* ... */},\n    headers: {/* ... */},\n    push: {/* ... */},\n    pull: {\n        responseModifier: async function(\n            plainResponse, // the exact response that was returned from the server\n            origin, // either 'handler' if plainResponse came from the pull.handler, or 'stream' if it came from the pull.stream\n            requestCheckpoint // if origin==='handler', the requestCheckpoint contains the checkpoint that was send to the backend\n        ) {\n            /**\n             * In this example we aggregate the checkpoint from the documents array\n             * that was returned from the graphql endpoint.\n             */\n            const docs = plainResponse;\n            return {\n                documents: docs,\n                checkpoint: docs.length === 0 ? requestCheckpoint : {\n                    name: lastOfArray(docs).name,\n                    updatedAt: lastOfArray(docs).updatedAt\n                }\n            };\n        }\n    },\n    /* ... */\n});\n\nHelper Functions\nRxDB provides the helper functions graphQLSchemaFromRxSchema(), pullQueryBuilderFromRxSchema(), pullStreamBuilderFromRxSchema() and pushQueryBuilderFromRxSchema() that can be used to generate handlers and schemas from the RxJsonSchema. To learn how to use them, please inspect the GraphQL Example.\nRxGraphQLReplicationState\nWhen you call myCollection.syncGraphQL() it returns a RxGraphQLReplicationState which can be used to subscribe to events, for debugging or other functions. It extends the RxReplicationState with some GraphQL specific methods.\n.setHeaders()\nChanges the headers for the replication after it has been set up.\nreplicationState.setHeaders({\n    Authorization: `...`\n});\n\nSending Cookies\nThe underlying fetch framework uses a same-origin policy for credentials per default. That means, cookies and session data is only shared if you backend and frontend run on the same domain and port. Pass the credential parameter to include cookies in requests to servers from different origins via:\nreplicationState.setCredentials('include');\n\nor directly pass it in the the syncGraphQL:\nsyncGraphQL({\n    /* ... */\n    credentials: 'include',\n    /* ... */\n})\n\nSee the fetch spec for more information about available options.\nNOTICE: To play around, check out the full example of the RxDB GraphQL replication with server and client\n"},"replication-websocket.html":{"url":"replication-websocket.html","title":"Replication Websocket","keywords":"","body":"Websocket Replication\nWith the websocket replication plugin, you can spawn a websocket server from a RxDB database in Node.js and replicate with it.\nNOTICE: The websocket replication plugin does not have any concept for authentication or permission handling.

You can solve this be changing the batches configuration.const replicationState = await myCollection.syncCouchDB({\nremote: 'http://...',\noptions: {\n    retry: true,\n    batch_size: 1, // only transfer one document per batch\n    batches_limit: 1 // only one batch in parallel\n}\n});\n\n\nWhen you replicate attachments bigger then 1mb you might cause the replication to stuck.

Because of the event-reduce algorithm cached queries are even valuable for optimization, when changes to the database occur between now and the last execution.\nCache Replacement Policy\nTo not let RxDB fill up all the memory, a cache replacement policy is defined that clears up the cached queries. This is implemented as a function which runs regularly, depending on when queries are created and the database is idle. The default policy should be good enough for most use cases but defining custom ones can also make sense.\nThe default policy\nThe default policy starts cleaning up queries depending on how much queries are in the cache and how much document data they contain.\n\nIt will never uncache queries that have subscribers to their results\nIt tries to always have less than 100 queries without subscriptions in the cache.\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have never executed and are older then 30 seconds\nIt prefers to uncache queries that have not been used for longer time\n\nOther references to queries\nWith JavaScript, it is not possible to count references to variables. Therefore it might happen that an uncached RxQuery is still referenced by the users code and used to get results. This should never be a problem, uncached queries must still work. Creating the same query again however, will result in having two RxQuery instances instead of one.\nUsing a custom policy\nA cache replacement policy is a normal JavaScript function according to the type RxCacheReplacementPolicy.\nIt gets the RxCollection as first parameter and the QueryCache as second. Then it iterates over the cached RxQuery instances and uncaches the desired ones with uncacheRxQuery(rxQuery). When you create your custom policy, you should have a look at the default.\nTo apply a custom policy to a RxCollection, add the function as attribute cacheReplacementPolicy.\nconst collection = await myDatabase.addCollections({\n    humans: {\n        schema: mySchema,\n        cacheReplacementPolicy: function(){ /* ... */ }\n    }\n});\n\n"},"rx-local-document.html":{"url":"rx-local-document.html","title":"LocalDocuments","keywords":"","body":"Local Documents\nLocal documents are a special class of documents which are used to store local metadata.\nThey come in handy when you want to store settings or additional data next to your documents.\n\nLocal Documents can exist on RxDatabase or RxCollection.\nLocal Document do not have to match the collections schema.\nLocal Documents do not get replicated.\nLocal Documents will not be found on queries.\nLocal Documents can not have attachments.\nLocal Documents will not get handled by the data-migration.\nThe id of a local document has the maxLength of 128 characters.\n\nAdd the local documents plugin\nTo enable the local documents, you have to add the local-documents plugin.\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\nimport { RxDBLocalDocumentsPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/local-documents';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBLocalDocumentsPlugin);\n\nActivate the plugin for a RxDatabase or RxCollection\nFor better performance, the local document plugin does not create a storage for every database or collection that is created.\nInstead you have to set localDocuments: true when you want to store local documents in the instance.\n// activate local documents on a RxDatabase\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStoragePouch('memory'),\n    localDocuments: true // \nNOTICE: If you want to store local documents in a RxCollection but NOT in the RxDatabase, you MUST NOT set localDocuments: true in the RxDatabase because it will only slow down the initial database creation.\ninsertLocal()\nCreates a local document for the database or collection.

Two different clients could do a write to the same document at the same time or while they are both offline. When the clients replicate the document state with the server, a conflict emerges that must be resolved by the system.\nIn RXDB, conflicts are normally resolved by setting a conflictHandler when creating a collection. The conflict handler is a JavaScript function that gets the two conflicting states of the same document and it will return the resolved document state.\nThe default conflict handler will always drop the fork state and use the master state to ensure that clients that have been offline for a long time, do not overwrite other clients changes when they go online again.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWith CRDTs (short for Conflict-free replicated data type), all document \nwrites are represented as CRDT operations in plain JSON. The CRDT operations are stored together with the document and each time a conflict arises, the CRDT conflict handler will automatically merge the operations in a deterministic way. Using CRDTs is an easy way to \"magically\" handle all conflict problems in your application by storing the deltas of writes together with the document data.\n\n  \n\n\nRxDB CRDT operations\nIn RXDB, a CRDT operation is defined with NoSQL update operators, like you might know them from MongoDB update operations or the RxDB update plugin.\nTo run the operators, RxDB uses the modifyjs library.\nA CRDT operator example:\nconst myCRDTOperation = {\n    // increment the points field by +1\n    $inc: {\n        points: 1\n    },\n    // set the modified field to true\n    $set: {\n        modified: true\n    }\n};\n\nOperators\nAt the moment, not all possible operators are implemented in modifyjs, if you need additional ones, you should make a pull request there.\nThe following operators can be used at this point in time:\n\n$min\n$max\n$inc\n$set\n$unset\n$push\n$pushAll\n$addToSet\n$pop\n$pullAll\n$rename\n\nFor the exact definition on how each operator behaves, check out the MongoDB documentation on update operators.\nInstallation\nTo use CRDTs with RxDB, you need the following:\n\nAdd the CRDT plugin via addRxPlugin.\nAdd a field to your schema that defines where to store the CRDT operations via getCRDTSchemaPart()\nSet the crdt options in your schema.\nDo NOT set a custom conflict handler, the plugin will use its own one.\n\n// import the relevant parts from the CRDT plugin\nimport {\n    getCRDTSchemaPart,\n    RxDDcrdtPlugin,\n    getCRDTConflictHandler\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/crdt';\n\n// add the CRDT plugin to RxDB\nimport { addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\naddRxPlugin(RxDDcrdtPlugin);\n\n// create a database\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';\nimport { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/dexie';\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  storage: getRxStorageDexie()\n});\n\n// create a schema with the CRDT options\nconst mySchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'id',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        id: {\n            type: 'string',\n            maxLength: 100\n        },\n        points: {\n            type: 'number',\n            maximum: 100,\n            minimum: 0\n        },\n        crdts: getCRDTSchemaPart() // use this field to store the CRDT operations\n    },\n    required: ['id', 'points'],\n    crdt: { // CRDT options\n        field: 'crdts'\n    }\n}\n\n// add a collection\nawait db.addCollections({\n    users: {\n        schema: mySchema\n    }\n});\n\n// insert a document\nconst myDocument = await db.users.insert({id: 'alice', points: 0});\n\n// run a CRDT operation that increments the 'points' by one\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nConditional CRDT operations\nBy default, all CRDTs operations will be run to build the current document state. But in many cases, more granular operations are required to better reflect the desired business logic. For these cases, conditional CRDTs can be used.\nFor example if you have a field points with a maximum of 100, you might want to only run an $inc operations, if the points value is less then 100.\nIn an conditional CRDT, you can specify a selector and the operation sets ifMatch and ifNotMatch. At each time the CRDT is applied to the document state, first the selector will run and evaluate which operations path must be used.\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT({\n    // only if the selector matches, the ifMatch operation will run\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $lt: 100\n        }\n    },\n    // an operation that runs if the selector matches\n    ifMatch: {\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    },\n    // if the selector does NOT match, you could run a different operation instead\n    ifNotMatch: {\n        // ...\n    }\n});\n\nRunning multiples operations at once\nBy default, one CRDT operation is applied to the document in a single database write.\nTo represent more complex logic chains, it might make sense to use multiple CRDTs and write them at once inside of a single atomic document write.\nFor these cases, the updateCRDT() method allows to pass an array of operations.\nawait myDocument.updateCRDT([\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    },\n    {\n        selector: { /** ... **/ },\n        ifMatch: { /** ... **/ }\n    }\n]);\n\nCRDTs on inserts\nWhen CRDTs are enabled with the plugin, all insert operations are automatically mapped as CRDT operation with the $set operator.\n// Calling RxCollection.insert()\nawait myRxCollection.insert({\n    id: 'foo'\n    points: 1\n});\n// is exactly equal to calling insertCRDT()\nawait myRxCollection.insertCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $set: {\n            id: 'foo'\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nWhen the same document is inserted in multiple client instances and then replicated, a conflict will emerge and the insert-CRDTs will overwrite each other in a deterministic order.\nYou can use insertCRDT() to make conditional insert operations with any logic. To check for the previous existence of a document, use the $exists query operation on the primary key of the document.\nawait myRxCollection.insertCRDT({\n    selector: {\n        // only run if the document did not exist before.\n        id: { $exists: false }\n    }, \n    ifMatch: {\n        // if the document did not exist, insert it\n        $set: {\n            id: 'foo'\n            points: 1\n        }\n    },\n    ifNotMatch: {\n        // if document existed already, increment the points by +1\n        $inc: {\n            points: 1\n        }\n    }\n});\n\nDeleting documents\nYou can delete a document with a CRDT operation by setting _deleted to true. Calling RxDocument.remove() will do exactly the same when CRDTs are activated.\nawait doc.updateCRDT({\n    ifMatch: {\n        $set: {\n            _deleted: true\n        }\n    }\n});\n\n// OR\nawait doc.remove();\n\nCRDTs with replication\nCRDT operations are stored inside of a special field besides your 'normal' document fields.\nWhen replicating document data with the RxDB replication or the CouchDB replication or even any custom replication, the CRDT operations must be replicated together with the document data as if they would be 'normal' a document property.\nWhen any instances makes a write to the document, it is required to update the CRDT operations accordingly. For example if your custom backend updates a document, it must also do that by adding a CRDT operation. In dev-mode RxDB will refuse to store any document data where the document properties do not match the result of the CRDT operations.\nWhy not automerge.js or yjs?\nThere are already CRDT libraries out there that have been considered to be used with RxDB. The biggeste ones are automerge and yjs. The decision was made to not use these but instead go for a more NoSQL way of designing the CRDT format because:\n\nUsers do not have to learn a new syntax but instead can use the NoSQL operations which they already know.\nRxDB is often used to replicate data with any custom backend on an already existing infrastructure. Using NoSQL operators instead of binary data in CRDTs, makes it easy to implement the exact same logic on these backends so that the backend can also do document writes and still be compliant to the RxDB CRDT plugin.\n\nWhen to not use CRDTs\nCRDT can only be use when your business logic allows to represent document changes via static json operators.\nIf you can have cases where user interaction is required to correctly merge conflicting document states, you cannot use CRDTs for that.\nAlso when CRDTs are used, it is no longer allowed to do non-CRDT writes to the document properties.\nTODOs\n\nClean up old CRDT operations by crunching them together\nCRDT streaming replication\n\n"},"third-party-plugins.html":{"url":"third-party-plugins.html","title":"Third Party Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Third Party Plugins\n\nrxdb-utils Additional features for RxDB like models, timestamps, default values, view and more.\nrxdb-hooks A set of hooks to integrate RxDB into react applications. \n\n"},"plugins.html":{"url":"plugins.html","title":"Creating Plugins","keywords":"","body":"Creating Plugins\nCreating your own plugin is very simple.

Instead, RxDB has to apply different techniques that better suite the offline-first, client side world.\nWhy RxDB does not have transactions\nWhen talking about transactions, we mean ACID transactions that guarantee the properties of atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.\nWith an ACID transaction you can mutate data dependent on the current state of the database. It is ensured that no other database operations happen in between your transaction and after the transaction has finished, it is guaranteed that the new data is actually written to the disc.\nTo implement ACID transactions on a single server, the database has to keep track on who is running transactions and then schedule these transactions so that they can run in isolation.\nAs soon as you have to split your database on multiple servers, transaction handling becomes way more difficult. The servers have to communicate with each other to find a consensus about which transaction can run and which has to wait. Network connections might break, or one server might complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of an error on another server. \nBut with RxDB you have multiple clients that can go randomly online or offline. The users can have different devices and the clock of these devices can go off by any time. To support ACID transactions here, RxDB would have to make the whole world stand still for all clients, while one client is doing a write operation. And even that can only work when all clients are online. Implementing that might be possible, but at the cost of an unpredictable amount of performance loss and not being able to support offline-first.\n\nA single write operation to a document is the only atomic thing you can do in RxDB.\n\nThe benefits of not having to support transactions:\n\nClients can read and write data without blocking each other.\nClients can write data while being offline and then replicate with a server when they are online again, called offline-first.\nCreating a compatible backend for the replication is easy so that RxDB can replicate with any existing infrastructure.\nOptimizations like Sharding can be used.\n\nRevisions\nWorking without transactions leads to having undefined state when doing multiple database operations at the same time. Most client side databases rely on a last-write-wins strategy on write operations. This might be a viable solution for some cases, but often this leads to strange problems that are hard to debug.\nInstead, to ensure that the behavior of RxDB is always predictable, RxDB relies on revisions for version control.\nEach document is stored together with its revision string, that looks like 1-12080c42d471e3d2625e49dcca3b8e1a and consists of:\n\nThe revision height, a number that starts with 1 and is increased with each write to that document.\nA revision hash that is a hash string of the documents data. Different RxStorage implementations might use different hashing methods.\n\nAn operation to the RxDB data layer does not only contain the new document data, but also the previous document data with its revision string. If the previous revision matches the revision that is currently stored in the database, the write operation can succeed. If the previous revision is different than the revision that is currently stored in the database, the operation will throw a local conflict error.\nConflicts\nThere are two types of conflicts in RxDB, the local conflict and the replication conflict.\nLocal conflicts\nA local conflict can happen when a write operation assumes a different previous document state, then what is currently stored in the database. This can happen when multiple parts of your application do simultaneous writes to the same document. This can happen on a single browser tab, or even when multiple tabs write at once or when a write appears while the document gets replicated from a remote server replication.\nWhen a local conflict appears, RxDB will throw an error. The calling code must then handle the error properly, depending on the application logic.\nInstead of handling local conflicts, in most cases it is easier to ensure that they cannot happen, by using atomic database operations like atomicUpdate(), atomicPatch() or atomicUpsert(). These write operations have a build in way to handle conflicts by re-applying the mutation functions to the conflicting document state.\nReplication conflicts\nA replication conflict appears when multiple clients write to the same documents at once and these documents are then replicated to the backend server. \nWhen you replicate with the Graphql replication and the replication primitives, RxDB assumes that conflicts are detected and resolved at the client side.\nWhen a document is send to the backend and the backend detected a conflict (by comparing revisions or other properties), the backend will respond with the actual document state so that the client can compare this with the local document state and create a new, resolved document state that is then pushed to the server again.

This makes the local database, not the server, the gateway for all persistent changes in application state.\n\nOffline first is not about having no internet connection\n\nWhile in the past, internet connection was an unstable, things are changing especially for mobile devices.\nMobile networks become better and having no internet becomes less common even in remote locations.\nSo if we did not care about offline first applications in the past, why should we even care now?\nIn the following I will point out why offline first applications are better, not because they support offline usage, but because of other reasons.\nUX is better without loading spinners\nIn 'normal' web applications, most user interactions like fetching, saving or deleting data, correspond to a request to the backend server. This means that each of these interactions require the user to await the unknown latency to and from a remote server while looking at a loading spinner.\nIn offline-first apps, the operations go directly against the local storage which happens almost instantly. There is no perceptible loading time and so it is not even necessary to implement a loading spinner at all. As soon as the user clicks, the UI represents the new state as if it was already changed in the backend.\n\n  \n\n\nMulti-tab usage just works\nMany, even big websites like amazon, reddit and stack overflow do not handle multi tab usage correctly. When a user has multiple tabs of the website open and does a login on one of these tabs, the state does not change on the other tabs.\nOn offline first applications, there is always exactly one state of the data across all tabs. Offline first databases (like RxDB) store the data inside of IndexedDb and share the state between all tabs of the same origin.\n\n  \n\n\nLatency is more important than bandwidth\nIn the past, often the bandwidth was the limiting factor on determining the loading time of an application.\nBut while bandwidth has improved over the years, latency became the limiting factor.\nYou can always increase the bandwidth by setting up more cables or sending more Starlink satellites to space.\nBut reducing the latency is not so easy. It is defined by the physical properties of the transfer medium, the speed of light and the distance to the server. All of these three are hard to optimize.\nOffline first application benefit from that because sending the initial state to the client can be done much faster with more bandwidth. And once the data is there, we do no longer have to care about the latency to the backend server.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRealtime comes for free\nMost websites lie to their users. They do not lie because they display wrong data, but because they display old data that was loaded from the backend at the time the user opened the site.\nTo overcome this, you could build a realtime website where you create a websocket that streams updates from the backend to the client. This means work. Your client needs to tell the server which page is currently opened and which updates the client is interested to. Then the server can push updates over the websocket and you can update the UI accordingly.\nWith offline first applications, you already have a realtime replication with the backend. Most offline first databases provide some concept of changestream or data subscriptions and with RxDB you can even directly subscribe to query results or single fields of documents. This makes it easy to have an always updated UI whenever data on the backend changes.\n\n  \n\n\n\nScales with data size, not with the amount of user interaction\nOn normal applications, each user interaction can result in multiple requests to the backend server which increase its load.\nThe more users interact with your application, the more backend resources you have to provide.\nOffline first applications do not scale up with the amount of user actions but instead they scale up with the amount of data.\nOnce that data is transferred to the client, the user can do as many interactions with it as required without connecting to the server.\nModern apps have longer runtimes\nIn the past you used websites only for a short time. You open it, perform some action and then close it again. This made the first load time the important metric when evaluating page speed.\nToday web applications have changed and with it the way we use them. Single page applications are opened once and then used over the whole day. Chat apps, email clients, PWAs and hybrid apps. All of these were made to have long runtimes.\nThis makes the time for user interactions more important than the initial loading time. Offline first applications benefit from that because there is often no loading time on user actions while loading the initial state to the client is not that relevant.\nYou might not need REST\nOn normal web applications, you make different requests for each kind of data interaction.\nFor that you have to define a swagger route, implement a route handler on the backend and create some client code to send or fetch data from that route. The more complex your application becomes, the more REST routes you have to maintain and implement.\nWith offline first apps, you have a way to hack around all this cumbersome work. You just replicate the whole state from the server to the client. The replication does not only run once, you have a realtime replication and all changes at one side are automatically there on the other side. On the client, you can access every piece of state with a simple database query.\nWhile this of course only works for amounts of data that the client can load and store, it makes implementing prototypes and simple apps much faster.\nYou might not need Redux\nData is hard, especially for UI applications where many things can happen at the same time.\nThe user is clicking around. Stuff is loaded from the server. All of these things interact with the global state of the app.\nTo manage this complexity it is common to use state management libraries like Redux or MobX. With them, you write all this lasagna code to wrap the mutation of data and to make the UI react to all these changes.\nOn offline first apps, your global state is already there in a single place stored inside of the local database.\nYou do not have to care whether this data came from the UI, another tab, the backend or another device of the same user. You can just make writes to the database and fetch data out of it.\n\n"},"downsides-of-offline-first.html":{"url":"downsides-of-offline-first.html","title":"Downsides of Offline First","keywords":"","body":"Downsides of Offline First\nSo you have read all these things about how the offline first paradigm makes it easy to create realtime web applications that even work when the user has no internet connection.\nBut there is no free lunch. The offline first paradigm is not the perfect approach for all kinds of apps.\n\nYou fully understood a technology when you know when not to use it\n\nIn the following I will point out the limitations you need to know before you decide to use RxDB or even before you decide to create an offline first application.\nIt only works with small datasets\nMaking data available offline means it must be loaded from the server and then stored at the clients device.\nYou need to load the full dataset on the first pageload and on every ongoing load you need to download the new changes to that set.\nWhile in theory you could download in infinite amount of data, in practice you have a limit how long the user can wait before having an up-to-date state.\nYou want to display chat messages like Whatsapp? No problem. Syncing all the messages a user could write, can be done with a few HTTP requests.\nWant to make a tool that displays server logs? Good luck downloading terabytes of data to the client just to search for a single string. This will not work.\nBesides the network usage, there is another limit for the size of your data.\nIn browsers you have some options for storage: Cookies, Localstorage, WebSQL and IndexedDB.\nBecause Cookies and Localstorage is slow and WebSQL is deprecated, you will use IndexedDB.\nThe limit of how much data you can store in IndexedDB depends on two factors: Which browser is used and how much disc space is left on the device. You can assume that at least a couple of hundred megabytes are available at least. The maximum is potentially hundreds of gigabytes or more, but the browser implementations vary. Chrome allows the browser to use up to 60% of the total disc space per origin. Firefox allows up to 50%. But on safari you can only store up to 1GB and the browser will prompt the user on each additional 200MB increment.\nThe problem is, that you have no chance to really predict how much data can be stored. So you have to make assumptions that are hopefully true for all of your users. Also, you have no way to increase that space like you would add another hard drive to your backend server. Once your clients reach the limit, you likely have to rewrite big parts of your applications.\nBrowser storage is not really persistent\nWhen data is stored inside IndexedDB or one of the other storage APIs, it cannot be trusted to stay there forever.\nApple for example deletes the data when the website was not used in the last 7 days. The other browsers also have logic to clean up the stored data, and in the end the user itself could be the one that deletes the browsers local data.\nThe most common way to handle this, is to replicate everything from the backend to the client again.\nOf course, this does not work for state that is not stored at the backend. So if you assume you can store the users private data inside the browser in a secure way, you are wrong.\n\n  \n\n\nThere can be conflicts\nImagine two of your users modify the same JSON document, while both are offline. After they go online again, their clients replicate the modified document to the server. Now you have two conflicting versions of the same document, and you need a way to determine how the correct new version of that document should look like. This process is called conflict resolution.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe default in many offline first databases is a deterministic conflict resolution strategy. Both conflicting versions of the document are kept in the storage and when you query for the document, a winner is determined by comparing the hashes of the document and only the winning document is returned. Because the comparison is deterministic, all clients and servers will always pick the same winner. This kind of resolution only works when it is not that important that one of the document changes gets dropped. Because conflicts are rare, this might be a viable solution for some use cases.\n\nA better resolution can be applied by listening to the changestream of the database. The changestream emits an event each time a write happens to the database. The event contains information about the written document and also a flag if there is a conflicting version. For each event with a conflict, you fetch all versions for that document and create a new document that contains the winning state. With that you can implement pretty complex conflict resolution strategies, but you have to manually code it for each collection of documents.\n\nInstead of the solving conflict once at every client, it can be made a bit easier by solely relying on the backend. This can be done when all of your clients replicate with the same single backend server. With RxDB's Graphql Replication each client side change is sent to the server where conflicts can be resolved and the winning document can be sent back to the clients.\n\nSometimes there is no way to solve a conflict with code. If your users edit text based documents or images, often only the users themselves can decide how the winning revision has to look. For these cases, you have to implement complex UI parts where the users can inspect the conflict and manage its resolution.\n\nYou do not have to handle conflicts if they cannot happen in the first place. You can achieve that by designing a write only database where existing documents cannot be touched. Instead of storing the current state in a single document, you store all the events that lead to the current state. Sometimes called the \"everything is a delta\" strategy, others would call it Event Sourcing. Like an accountant that does not need an eraser, you append all changes and afterwards aggregate the current state at the client.\n// create one new document for each change to the users balance\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 100} // balance increased by $100\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: -50} // balance decreased by $50\n{id: new Date().toJSON(), change: 200} // balance increased by $200\n\n\nThere is this thing called conflict-free replicated data type, short CRDT. Using a CRDT library like automerge will magically solve all of your conflict problems. Until you use it in production where you observe that implementing CRDTs has basically the same complexity as implementing conflict resolution strategies.\n\n\nRealtime is a lie\nSo you replicate stuff between the clients and your backend. Each change on one side directly changes the state of the other sides in realtime. But this \"realtime\" is not the same as in realtime computing. In the offline first world, the word realtime was introduced by firebase and is more meant as a marketing slogan than a technical description.\nThere is an internet between your backend and your clients and everything you do on one machine takes at least once the latency until it can affect anything on the other machines. You have to keep this in mind when you develop anything where the timing is important, like a multiplayer game or a stock trading app.\nEven when you run a query against the local database, there is no \"real\" realtime.\nClient side databases run on JavaScript and JavaScript runs on a single CPU that might be partially blocked because the user is running some background processes. So you can never guarantee a response deadline which violates the time constraint of realtime computing.\n\n  \n\n\nEventual consistency\nAn offline first app does not have a single source of truth. There is a source on the backend, one on the own client, and also each other client has its own definition of truth. At the moment your user starts the app, the local state is hopefully already replicated with the backend and all other clients. But this does not have to be true, the states can have converged and you have to plan for that.\nThe user could update a document based on wrong assumptions because it was not fully replicated at that point in time because the user is offline. A good way to handle this problem is to show the replication state in the UI and tell the user when the replication is running, stopped, paused or finished.\nAnd some data is just too important to be \"eventual consistent\". Create a wire transfer in your online banking app while you are offline. You keep the smartphone laying at your night desk and when you use again in the next morning, it goes online and replicates the transaction. No thank you, do not use offline first for these kind of things, or at least you have to display the replication state of each document in the UI.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPermissions and authentication\nEvery offline first app that goes beyond a prototype, does likely not have the same global state for all of its users. Each user has a different set of documents that are allowed to be replicated or seen by the user. So you need some kind of authentication and permission handling to divide the documents.\nThe easy way is to just create one database for each user on the backend and only allow to replicate that one. Creating that many databases is not really a problem with for example CouchDB, and it makes permission handling easy.\nBut as soon as you want to query all of your data in the backend, it will bite back. Your data is not at a single place, it is distributed between all of the user specific databases. This becomes even more complex as soon as you store information together with the documents that is not allowed to be seen by outsiders. You not only have to decide which documents to replicate, but also which fields of them.\nSo what you really want is a single datastore in the backend and then replicate only the allowed document parts to each of the users.\nThis always requires you to implement your custom replication endpoint like what you do with RxDBs GraphQL Replication.\nYou have to migrate the client database\nWhile developing your app, sooner or later you want to change the data layout. You want to add some new fields to documents or change the format of them. So you have to update the database schema and also migrate the stored documents.\nWith 'normal' applications, this is already hard enough and often dangerous. You wait until midnight, stop the webserver, make a database backup, deploy the new schema and then you hope that nothing goes wrong while it updates that many documents.\nWith offline first applications, it is even more fun. You do not only have to migrate your local backend database, you also have to provide a migration strategy for all of these client databases out there. And you also cannot migrate everything at the same time. The clients can only migrate when the new code was updated from the appstore or the user visited your website again. This could be today or in a few weeks.\nPerformance is not native\nWhen you create a web based offline first app, you cannot store data directly on the users filesystem. In fact there are many layers between your JavaScript code and the filesystem of the operation system. Let's say you insert a document in RxDB:\n\nYou call the RxDB API to validate and store the data\nRxDB calls the underlying RxStorage, for example PouchDB.\nPouchdb calls its underlying storage adapter\nThe storage adapter calls IndexedDB\nThe browser runs its internal handling of the IndexedDB API\nIn most browsers IndexedDB is implemented on top of SQLite\nSQLite calls the OS to store the data in the filesystem\n\nAll these layers are abstractions. They are not build for exactly that one use case, so you lose some performance to tunnel the data through the layer itself, and you also lose some performance because the abstraction does not exactly provide the functions that are needed by the layer above and it will overfetch data.\nYou will not find a benchmark comparison between how many transactions per second you can run on the browser compared to a server based database. Because it makes no sense to compare them. Browsers are slower, JavaScript is slower.\n\nIs it fast enough?\n\nWhat you really care about is \"Is it fast enough?\". For most use cases, the answer is yes. Offline first apps are UI based and you do not need to process a million transactions per second, because your user will not click the save button that often. \"Fast enough\" means that the data is processed in under 16 milliseconds so that you can render the updated UI in the next frame. This is of course not true for all use cases, so you better think about the performance limit before starting with the implementation.\nNothing is predictable\nYou have a PostgreSQL database and run a query over 1000ths of rows, which takes 200 milliseconds. Works great, so you now want to do something similar at the client device in your offline first app. How long does it take? You cannot know because people have different devices, and even equal devices have different things running in the background that slow the CPUs. So you cannot predict performance and as described above, you cannot even predict the storage limit. So if your app does heavy data analytics, you might better run everything on the backend and just send the results to the client.\nThere is no relational data\nI started creating RxDB many years ago and while still maintaining it, I often worked with all these other offline first databases out there. RxDB and all of these other ones, are based on some kind of document databases similar to NoSQL. Often people want to have a relational database like the SQL one they use at the backend. \nSo why are there no real relations in offline first databases? I could answer with these arguments like how JavaScript works better with document based data, how performance is better when having no joins or even how NoSQL queries are more composable. But the truth is, everything is NoSQL because it makes replication easy. An SQL query that mutates data in different tables based on some selects and joins, cannot be partially replicated without breaking the client. You have foreign keys that point to other rows and if these rows are not replicated yet, you have a problem. To implement a robust replication protocol for relational data, you need some stuff like a reliable atomic clock and you have to block queries over multiple tables while a transaction replicated. Watch this guy implementing offline first replication on top of SQLite or read this discussion about implementing offline first in supabase.\nSo creating replication for an SQL offline first database is way more work than just adding some network protocols on top of PostgreSQL. It might not even be possible for clients that have no reliable clock.\n\n  \n\n\n"},"slow-indexeddb.html":{"url":"slow-indexeddb.html","title":"Slow IndexedDB","keywords":"","body":"Why IndexedDB is slow and what to use instead\nSo you have a JavaScript web application that needs to store data at the client side, either to make it offline usable, just for caching purposes or for other reasons.\nFor in-browser data storage, you have some options:\n\nCookies are sent with each HTTP request, so you cannot store more then a few strings in them.\nWebSQL is deprecated because it never was a real standard and turning it into a standard would have been too difficult.\nLocalStorage is a synchronous API over asynchronous IO-access. Storing and reading data can fully block the JavaScript process so you cannot use LocalStorage for more then few simple key-value pairs.\nThe FileSystem API could be used to store plain binary files, but it is only supported in chrome for now.\nIndexedDB is an indexed key-object database. It can store json data and iterate over its indexes. It is widely supported and stable.\n\nIt becomes clear that the only way to go is IndexedDB. You start developing your app and everything goes fine.\nBut as soon as your app gets bigger, more complex or just handles more data, you might notice something. IndexedDB is slow. Not slow like a database on a cheap server, even slower! Inserting a few hundred documents can take up several seconds. Time which can be critical for a fast page load. Even sending data over the internet to the backend can be faster then storing it inside of an IndexedDB database.\n\nTransactions vs Throughput\n\nSo before we start complaining, lets analyze what exactly is slow. When you run tests on Nolans Browser Database Comparison you can see that inserting 1k documents into IndexedDB takes about 80 milliseconds, 0.08ms per document. This is not really slow. It is quite fast and it is very unlikely that you want to store that many document at the same time at the client side. But the key point here is that all these documents get written in a single transaction.\nI forked the comparison tool here and changed it to use one transaction per document write. And there we have it. Inserting 1k documents with one transaction per write, takes about 2 seconds. Interestingly if we increase the document size to be 100x bigger, it still takes about the same time to store them. This makes clear that the limiting factor to IndexedDB performance is the transaction handling, not the data throughput.\n\n  \n\n\nTo fix your IndexedDB performance problems you have to make sure to use as less data transfers/transactions as possible.\nSometimes this is easy, as instead of iterating over a documents list and calling single inserts, with RxDB you could use the bulk methods to store many document at once.\nBut most of the time is not so easy. Your user clicks around, data gets replicated from the backend, another browser tab writes data. All these things can happen at random time and you cannot crunch all that data in a single transaction.\nAnother solution is to just not care about performance at all. In a few releases the browser vendors will have optimized IndexedDB and everything is fast again. Well, IndexedDB was slow in 2013 and it is still slow today. If this trend continues, it will still be slow in a few years from now. Waiting is not an option. The chromium devs made a statement to focus on optimizing read performance, not write performance.\nSwitching to WebSQL (even if it is deprecated) is also not an option because, like the comparison tool shows, it has even slower transactions.\nSo you need a way to make IndexedDB faster. In the following I lay out some performance optimizations than can be made to have faster reads and writes in IndexedDB.\nHINT: You can reproduce all performance tests in this repo. In all tests we work on a dataset of 40000 human documents with a random age between 1 and 100.\nBatched Cursor\nWith IndexedDB 2.0, new methods were introduced which can be utilized to improve performance. With the getAll() method, a faster alternative to the old openCursor() can be created which improves performance when reading data from the IndexedDB store.\nLets say we want to query all user documents that have an age greater then 25 out of the store.\nTo implement a fast batched cursor that only needs calls to getAll() and not to getAllKeys(), we first need to create an age index that contains the primary id as last field.\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\nThis is required because the age field is not unique, and we need a way to checkpoint the last returned batch so we can continue from there in the next call to getAll().\nconst maxAge = 25;\nlet result = [];\nconst tx: IDBTransaction = db.transaction([storeName], 'readonly', TRANSACTION_SETTINGS);\nconst store = tx.objectStore(storeName);\nconst index = store.index('age-index');\nlet lastDoc;\nlet done = false;\n/**\n * Run the batched cursor until all results are retrieved\n * or the end of the index is reached.\n */\nwhile (done === false) {\n    await new Promise((res, rej) => {\n        const range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n          /**\n           * If we have a previous document as checkpoint,\n           * we have to continue from it's age and id values.\n           */\n            [\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.age : -Infinity,\n                lastDoc ? lastDoc.id : -Infinity,\n            ],\n            [\n                maxAge + 0.00000001,\n                String.fromCharCode(65535)\n            ],\n            true,\n            false\n        );\n        const openCursorRequest = index.getAll(range, batchSize);\n        openCursorRequest.onerror = err => rej(err);\n        openCursorRequest.onsuccess = e => {\n            const subResult: TestDocument[] = e.target.result;\n            lastDoc = lastOfArray(subResult);\n            if (subResult.length === 0) {\n                done = true;\n            } else {\n                result = result.concat(subResult);\n            }\n            res();\n        };\n    });\n}\nconsole.dir(result);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs the performance test results show, using a batched cursor can give a huge improvement. Interestingly choosing a high batch size is important. When you known that all results of a given IDBKeyRange are needed, you should not set a batch size at all and just directly query all documents via getAll().\nRxDB uses batched cursors in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nIndexedDB Sharding\nSharding is a technique, normally used in server side databases, where the database is partitioned horizontally. Instead of storing all documents at one table/collection, the documents are split into so called shards and each shard is stored on one table/collection. This is done in server side architectures to spread the load between multiple physical servers which increases scalability.\nWhen you use IndexedDB in a browser, there is of course no way to split the load between the client and other servers. But you can still benefit from sharding. Partitioning the documents horizontally into multiple IndexedDB stores, has shown to have a big performance improvement in write- and read operations while only increasing initial pageload slightly.\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown in the performance test results, sharding should always be done by IDBObjectStore and not by database. Running a batched cursor over the whole dataset with 10 store shards in parallel is about 28% faster then running it over a single store. Initialization time increases minimal from 9 to 17 milliseconds.\nGetting a quarter of the dataset by batched iterating over an index, is even 43% faster with sharding then when a single store is queried.\nAs downside, getting 10k documents by their id is slower when it has to run over the shards.\nAlso it can be much effort to recombined the results from the different shards into the required query result. When a query without a limit is done, the sharding method might cause a data load huge overhead.\nSharding can be used with RxDB with the Sharding Plugin.\nCustom Indexes\nIndexes improve the query performance of IndexedDB significant. Instead of fetching all data from the storage when you search for a subset of it, you can iterate over the index and stop iterating when all relevant data has been found.\nFor example to query for all user documents that have an age greater than 25, you would create an age+id index.\nTo be able to run a batched cursor over the index, we always need our primary key (id) as the last index field.\nInstead of doing this, you can use a custom index which can improve the performance. The custom index runs over a helper field ageIdCustomIndex which is added to each document on write. Our index now only contains a single string field instead of two (age-number and id-string).\n// On document insert add the ageIdCustomIndex field.\nconst idMaxLength = 20; // must be known to craft a custom index  \ndocData.ageIdCustomIndex = docData.age + docData.id.padStart(idMaxLength, ' ');\nstore.put(docData);\n// ...\n\n// normal index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index',\n    [\n        'age',\n        'id'\n    ]\n);\n\n// custom index\nmyIndexedDBObjectStore.createIndex(\n    'age-index-custom',\n    [\n        'ageIdCustomIndex'\n    ]\n);\n\nTo iterate over the index, you also use a custom crafted keyrange, depending on the last batched cursor checkpoint. Therefore the maxLength of id must be known.\n// keyrange for normal index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    [25, ''],\n    [Infinity, Infinity],\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n// keyrange for custom index\nconst range = IDBKeyRange.bound(\n    // combine both values to a single string\n    25 + ''.padStart(idMaxLength, ' '),\n    Infinity,\n    true,\n    false\n);\n\n\n  \n\n\nAs shown, using a custom index can further improve the performance of running a batched cursor by about 10%.\nAnother big benefit of using custom indexes, is that you can also encode boolean values in them, which cannot be done with normal IndexedDB indexes.\nRxDB uses custom indexes in the IndexedDB RxStorage.\nRelaxed durability\nChromium based browsers allow to set durability to relaxed when creating an IndexedDB transaction. Which runs the transaction in a less secure durability mode, which can improve the performance.\n\nThe user agent may consider that the transaction has successfully committed as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the operating system, without subsequent verification.\n\nAs shown here, using the relaxed durability mode can improve performance slightly. The best performance improvement could be measured when many small transactions have to be run. Less, bigger transaction do not benefit that much.\nExplicit transaction commits\nBy explicitly committing a transaction, another slight performance improvement can be achieved. Instead of waiting for the browser to commit an open transaction, we call the commit() method to explicitly close it.\n// .commit() is not available on all browsers, so first check if it exists.\nif (transaction.commit) {\n    transaction.commit()\n}\n\nThe improvement of this technique is minimal, but observable as these tests show.\nIn-Memory on top of IndexedDB\nTo prevent transaction handling and to fix the performance problems, we need to stop using IndexedDB as a database. Instead all data is loaded into the memory on the initial page load. Here all reads and writes happen in memory which is about 100x faster. Only some time after a write occurred, the memory state is persisted into IndexedDB with a single write transaction. In this scenario IndexedDB is used as a filesystem, not as a database.\nThere are some libraries that already do that:\n\nLokiJS with the IndexedDB Adapter\nAbsurd-SQL\nSQL.js with the empscripten Filesystem API\nDuckDB Wasm\n\nIn-Memory: Persistence\nOne downside of not directly using IndexedDB, is that your data is not persistent all the time. And when the JavaScript process exists without having persisted to IndexedDB, data can be lost. To prevent this from happening, we have to ensure that the in-memory state is written down to the disc. One point is make persisting as fast as possible. LokiJS for example has the incremental-indexeddb-adapter which only saves new writes to the disc instead of persisting the whole state. Another point is to run the persisting at the correct point in time. For example the RxDB LokiJS storage persists in the following situations:\n\nWhen the database is idle and no write or query is running. In that time we can persist the state if any new writes appeared before.\nWhen the window fires the beforeunload event we can assume that the JavaScript process is exited any moment and we have to persist the state. After beforeunload there are several seconds time which are sufficient to store all new changes. This has shown to work quite reliable.\n\nThe only missing event that can happen is when the browser exists unexpectedly like when it crashes or when the power of the computer is shut of.\nIn-Memory: Multi Tab Support\nOne big difference between a web application and a 'normal' app, is that your users can use the app in multiple browser tabs at the same time. But when you have all database state in memory and only periodically write it to disc, multiple browser tabs could overwrite each other and you would loose data. This might not be a problem when you rely on a client-server replication, because the lost data might already be replicated with the backend and therefore with the other tabs. But this would not work when the client is offline.\nThe ideal way to solve that problem, is to use a SharedWorker. A SharedWorker is like a WebWorker that runs its own JavaScript process only that the SharedWorker is shared between multiple contexts. You could create the database in the SharedWorker and then all browser tabs could request the Worker for data instead of having their own database. But unfortunately the SharedWorker API does not work in all browsers. Safari dropped its support and InternetExplorer or Android Chrome, never adopted it. Also it cannot be polyfilled. UPDATE: Apple added SharedWorkers back in Safari 142\nInstead, we could use the BroadcastChannel API to communicate between tabs and then apply a leader election between them. The leader election ensures that, no matter how many tabs are open, always one tab is the Leader.\n\n  \n\n\nThe disadvantage is that the leader election process takes some time on the initial page load (about 150 milliseconds). Also the leader election can break when a JavaScript process is fully blocked for a longer time. When this happens, a good way is to just reload the browser tab to restart the election process.\nUsing a leader election is implemented in the RxDB LokiJS Storage.\nFurther read\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nSpeeding up IndexedDB reads and writes\nSQLITE ON THE WEB: ABSURD-SQL\nSQLite in a PWA with FileSystemAccessAPI\nResponse to this article by Oren Eini\n\n"},"why-nosql.html":{"url":"why-nosql.html","title":"Why NoSQL","keywords":"","body":"Why it has to be NoSQL\nRxDB, a client side, offline first, JavaScript database, is now several years old.\nOften new users appear in the chat and ask for that one simple feature:\nThey want to store and query relational data.\n\nSo why not just implement SQL?\n\nAll these client databases out there have on some kind\nof document-based, NoSQL like, storage engine. PouchDB, Firebase, AWS Datastore, RethinkDB's Horizon, Meteor's Minimongo, Parse, Realm. They all do not have real relational data.\nThey might have some kind of weak relational foreign keys like the RxDB Population\nor the relational models of AWS Datastore.\nBut these relations are weak. The foreign keys are not enforced to be valid like in PostgreSQL, and you cannot query\nthe rows with complex subqueries over different tables or collections and then make mutations based on the result.\nThere must be a reason for that. In fact, there are multiple of them and in the following I want to show you why you can neither have, nor want real relational data when you have a client-side database with replication.\n\n  \n\n\n\nRelational queries in NoSQL\nWhat most people want from a relational database, is to run queries over multiple tables.\nSome people think that they cannot do that with NoSQL, so let me explain.\nLet's say you have two tables with customers and cities where each city has an id and each customer has a city_id. You want to get every customer that resides in Tokyo. With SQL, you would use a query like this:\nSELECT *\nFROM city\nWHERE city.name = 'Tokyo'\nLEFT JOIN customer ON customer.city_id = city.id;\n\nWith NoSQL you can just do the same, but you have to write it manually:\nconst cityDocument = await db.cities.findOne().where('name').equals('Tokyo').exec();\nconst customerDocuments = await db.customers.find().where('city_id').equals(cityDocument.id).exec();\n\nSo what are the differences? The SQL version would run faster on a remote database server because it would aggregate all data there and return only the customers as result set. But when you have a local database, it is not really a difference. Querying the two tables by hand would have about the same performance as a JavaScript implementation of SQL that is running locally.\nThe main benefit from using SQL is, that the SQL query runs inside of a single transaction. When a change to one of our two tables happens, while our query runs, the SQL database will ensure that the write does not affect the result of the query. This could happen with NoSQL, while you retrieve the city document, the customer table gets changed and your result is not correct for the dataset that was there when you started the querying. As a workaround, you could observe the database for changes and if a change happened in between, you have to re-run everything.\n\n  \n\n\n\nReliable replication\nIn an offline first app, your data is replicated from your backend servers to your users and you want it to be reliable.\nThe replication is reliable when, no matter what happens, every online client is able to run a replication\nand end up with the exact same database state as any other client.\nImplementing a reliable replication protocol is hard because of the circumstances of your app:\n\nYour users have unknown devices.\nThey have an unknown internet speed.\nThey can go offline or online at any time.\nClients can be offline for a several days with un-synced changes.\nYou can have many users at the same time.\nThe users can do many database writes at the same time to the same entities.\n\nNow lets say you have a SQL database and one of your users, called Alice, runs a query that mutates some rows, based on a condition.\n# mark all items out of stock as inStock=FALSE\nUPDATE\n  Table_A\nSET\n  Table_A.inStock = FALSE\nFROM\n  Table_A\nWHERE\n  Table_A.amountInStock = 0\n\nAt first, the query runs on the local database of Alice and everything is fine.\nBut at the same time Bob, the other client, updates a row and sets amountInStock from 0 to 1.\nNow Bob's client replicates the changes from Alice and runs them. Bob will end up with a different database state than Alice because on one of the rows, the WHERE condition was not met. This is not what we want, so our replication protocol should be able to fix it. For that it has to reduce all mutations into a deterministic state.\nLet me loosely describe how \"many\" SQL replications work:\nInstead of just running all replicated queries, we remember a list of all past queries. When a new query comes in that happened before our last query, we roll back the previous queries, run the new query, and then re-execute our own queries on top of that. For that to work, all queries need a timestamp so we can order them correctly. But you cannot rely on the clock that is running at the client. Client side clocks drift, they can run in a different speed or even a malicious client modifies the clock on purpose. So instead of a normal timestamp, we have to use a Hybrid Logical Clock that takes a client generated id and the number of the clients query into account. Our timestamp will then look like 2021-10-04T15:29.40.273Z-0000-eede1195b7d94dd5. These timestamps can be brought into a deterministic order and each client can run the replicated queries in the same order. Watch this video to learn how to implement that.\nWhile this sounds easy and realizable, we have some problems:\nThis kind of replication works great when you replicate between multiple SQL servers. It does not work great when you replicate between a single server and many clients.\n\nAs mentioned above, clients can be offline for a long time which could require us to do many and heavy rollbacks on each client when someone comes back after a long time and replicates the change.\nWe have many clients where many changes can appear and our database would have to roll back many times.\nDuring the rollback, the database cannot be used for read queries.\nIt is required that each client downloads and keeps the whole query history.\n\nWith NoSQL, replication works different. A new client downloads all current documents and each time a document changes, that document is downloaded again. Instead of replicating the query that leads to a data change, we just replicate the changed data itself. Of course, we could do the same with SQL and just replicate the affected rows of a query, like WatermelonDB does it. This was a clever way to go for WatermelonDB, because it was initially made for React Native and did want to use the fast SQLite instead of the slow AsyncStorage. But in a more general view, it defeats the whole purpose of having a replicating relational database because you have transactions locally, but these transactions become meaningless as soon as the data goes through the replication layer.\n\n  \n\n\n\nServer side validation\nWhenever there is client-side input, it must be validated on the server.\nOn a NoSQL database, validating a changed document is trivial. The client sends the changed document to the server, and the server can then check if the user was allowed to modify that one document and if the applied changes are ok.\nSafely validating a SQL query is up to impossible.\n\nYou first need a way to parse the query with all this complex SQL syntax and keywords.\nYou have to ensure that the query does not DOS your system.\nThen you check which rows would be affected when running the query and if the user was allowed to change them\nThen you check if the mutation to that rows are valid.\n\nFor simple queries like an insert/update/delete to a single row, this might be doable. But a query with 4 LEFT JOIN will be hard.\nEvent optimization\nWith NoSQL databases, each write event always affects exactly one document. This makes it easy to optimize the processing of events at the client. For example instead of handling multiple updates to the same document, when the user comes online again, you could skip everything but the last event.\nSimilar to that you can optimize observable query results. When you query the customers table you get a query result of 10 customers. Now a new customer is added to the table and you want to know how the new query results look like. You could analyze the event and now you know that you only have to add the new customer to the previous results set, instead of running the whole query again. These types of optimizations can be run with all NoSQL queries and even work with limit and skip operators. In RxDB this all happens in the background with the EventReduce algorithm that calculates new query results on incoming changes.\nThese optimizations do not really work with relational data. A change to one table could affect a query to any other tables. and you could not just calculate the new results based on the event. You would always have to re-run the full query to get the updated results.\nMigration without relations\nSooner or later you change the layout of your data. You update the schema and you also have to migrate the stored rows/documents. In NoSQL this is often not a big deal because all of your documents are modeled as self containing piece of data. There is an old version of the document and you have a function that transforms it into the new version.\nWith relational data, nothing is self-contained. The relevant data for the migration of a single row could be inside any other table. So when changing the schema, it will be important which table to migrate first and how to orchestrate the migration or relations.\nEverything can be downgraded to NoSQL\nTo use an offline first database in the frontend, you have to make it compatible with your backend APIs.\nMaking software things compatible often means you have to find the lowest common denominator.\nWhen you have SQLite in the frontend and want to replicate it with the backend, the backend also has to use SQLite. You cannot even use PostgreSQL because it has a different SQL dialect and some queries might fail. But you do not want to let the frontend dictate which technologies to use in the backend just to make replication work.\nWith NoSQL, you just have documents and writes to these documents. You can build a document based layer on top of everything by removing functionality. It can be built on top of SQL, but also on top of a graph database or even on top of a key-value store like levelDB.\nWith that document layer you can build a replication API that serves documents sorted by the last update time and there you have a realtime replication.\nCaching query results\nMemory is limited and this is especially true for client side applications where you never know how much free RAM the device really has. You want to have a fast realtime UI, so your database must be able to cache query results.\nWhen you run a SQL query like SELECT .. the result of it can be anything. An array, a number, a string, a single row, it depends on how the query goes on. So the caching strategy can only be to keep the result in memory, once for each query.\nThis scales very bad because the more queries you run, the more results you have to store in memory.\nWhen you make a query to a NoSQL collection, you always know how the result will look like. It is a list of documents, based on the collection's schema (if you have one). The result set is stored in memory, but because you get similar documents for different queries to the same collection, we can de-duplicated the documents. So when multiple queries return the same document, we only have it in the cache once and each query caches point to the same memory object. So no matter how many queries you make, your cache maximum is the collection size.\nTypeScript support\nModern web apps are build with TypeScript and you want the transpiler to know the types of your query result so it can give you build time errors when something does not match. This is quite easy on document based systems. The typings of for each document of a collection can be generated from the schema, and all queries to that collection will always return the given document type. With SQL you have to manually write the typings for each query by hand because it can contain all these aggregate functions that affect the type of the query's result.\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat you lose with NoSQL\n\nYou can not run relational queries across tables inside a single transaction.\nYou can not mutate documents based on a WHERE clause, in a single transaction.\nYou need to resolve replication conflicts on a per-document basis.\n\nBut there is database XY\nYes, there are SQL databases out there that run on the client side or have replication, but not both.\n\nWebSQL / sql.js: In the past there was WebSQL in the browser. It was a direct mapping to SQLite because all browsers used the SQLite implementation. You could store relational data in it, but there was no concept of replication at any point in time. sql.js is an SQLite complied to JavaScript. It has not replication and it has (for now) no persistent storage, everything is stored in memory.\nWatermelonDB is a SQL databases that runs in the client. WatermelonDB uses a document-based replication that is not able to replicate relational queries.\nCockroach / Spanner/ PostgreSQL etc. are SQL databases with replication. But they run on servers, not on clients, so they can make different trade offs.\n\nFurther read\n\nCockroach Labs: Living Without Atomic Clocks\nMake a PR to this file if you have more interesting links to that topic\nTransactions, Conflicts and Revisions in RxDB\n\n"},"alternatives.html":{"url":"alternatives.html","title":"Alternatives","keywords":"","body":"Alternatives for realtime offline-first JavaScript applications\nTo give you an augmented view over the topic of client side JavaScript databases, this page contains all known alternatives to RxDB.

The firebase realtime database stores data as a big unstructured JSON tree that is replicated between clients and the backend.\nFirebase - Cloud Firestore\nThe firestore is the successor to the realtime database. The big difference is that it behaves more like a 'normal' database that stores data as documents inside of collections. The conflict resolution strategy of firestore is always last-write-wins which might or might not be suitable for your use case.\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that firebase products are only able to replicate with the firebase cloud hosted backend, which creates a vendor lock-in. RxDB can replicate with any self hosted CouchDB server or custom GraphQL endpoints.\nMeteor\n\n  \n\n\nMeteor (since 2012) is one of the oldest technologies for JavaScript realtime applications. Meteor is not a library but a whole framework with its own package manager, database management and replication protocol.\nBecause of how it works, it has proven to be hard to integrate it with other modern JavaScript frameworks like angular, vue.js or svelte.\nMeteor uses MongoDB in the backend and can replicate with a Minimongo database in the frontend.\nWhile testing, it has proven to be impossible to make a meteor app offline first capable. There are some projects that might do this, but all are unmaintained.\nMinimongo\nForked in Jan 2014 from meteorJSs' minimongo package, Minimongo is a client-side, in-memory, JavaScript version of MongoDB with backend replication over HTTP. Similar to MongoDB, it stores data in documents inside of collections and also has the same query syntax. Minimongo has different storage adapters for IndexedDB, WebSQL, LocalStorage and SQLite.\nCompared to RxDB, Minimongo has no concept of revisions or conflict handling, which might lead to undefined behavior when used with replication or in multiple browser tabs. Minimongo has no observable queries or changestream.\nWatermelonDB\n\n  \n\n\nWatermelonDB is a reactive & asynchronous JavaScript database. While originally made for React and React Native, it can also be used with other JavaScript frameworks. The main goal of WatermelonDB is performance within an application with lots of data.\nIn React Native, WatermelonDB uses the provided SQLite database. In a browser, LokiJS can be used to store and query data.\nAWS Amplify\n\n  \n\n\nAWS Amplify is a collection of tools and libraries to develop web- and mobile frontend applications. Similar to firebase, it provides everything needed like authentication, analytics, a REST API, storage and so on. Everything hosted in the AWS Cloud, even when they state that \"AWS Amplify is designed to be open and pluggable for any custom backend or service\". For realtime replication, AWS Amplify can connect to an AWS App-Sync GraphQL endpoint.\nAWS Datastore\nSince december 2019 the Amplify library includes the AWS Datastore which is a document-based, client side database that is able to replicate data via AWS AppSync in the background.\nThe main difference to other projects is the complex project configuration via the amplify cli and the bit confusing query syntax that works over functions. Complex Queries with multiple OR/AND statements are not possible which might change in the future.\nLocal development is hard because the AWS AppSync mock does not support realtime replication. It also is not really offline-first because a user login is always required.\n// An AWS datastore OR query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, c => c.or(\n  c => c.rating(\"gt\", 4).status(\"eq\", PostStatus.PUBLISHED)\n));\n\n// An AWS datastore SORT query\nconst posts = await DataStore.query(Post, Predicates.ALL, {\n  sort: s => s.rating(SortDirection.ASCENDING).title(SortDirection.DESCENDING)\n});\n\nThe biggest difference to RxDB is that you have to use the AWS cloud backends. This might not be a problem if your data is at AWS anyway.\nRethinkDB\n\n  \n\n\nRethinkDB is a backend database that pushed dynamic JSON data to the client in realtime. It was founded in 2009 and the company shut down in 2016.\nRethink db is not a client side database, it streams data from the backend to the client which of course does not work while offline.\nHorizon\nHorizon is the client side library for RethinkDB which provides useful functions like authentication, permission management and subscription to a RethinkDB backend. Offline support never made it to horizon.\nSupabase\n\n  \n\n\n\nSupabase labels itself as \"an open source Firebase alternative\". It is a collection of open source tools that together mimic many Firebase features, most of them by providing a wrapper around a PostgreSQL database. While it has realtime queries that run over the wire, like with RethinkDB, Supabase has no client-side storage or replication feature and therefore is not offline first.\nCouchDB\n\n  \n\n\nApache CouchDB is a server-side, document-oriented database that is mostly known for its multi-master replication feature. Instead of having a master-slave replication, with CouchDB you can run replication in any constellation without having a master server as bottleneck where the server even can go off- and online at any time. This comes with the drawback of having a slow replication with much network overhead.\nCouchDB has a changestream and a query syntax similar to MongoDB.\nPouchDB\n\n  \n\n\n\nPouchDB is a JavaScript database that is compatible with most of the CouchDB API. It has an adapter system that allows you to switch out the underlying storage layer. There are many adapters like for IndexedDB, SQLite, the Filesystem and so on. The main benefit is to be able to replicate data with any CouchDB compatible endpoint.\nBecause of the CouchDB compatibility, PouchDB has to do a lot of overhead in handling the revision tree of document, which is why it can show bad performance for bigger datasets.\nRxDB was originally build around PouchDB until the storage layer was abstracted out in version 10.0.0 so it now allows to use different RxStorage implementations. PouchDB has some performance issues because of how it has to store the document revision tree to stay compatible with the CouchDB API.\nCouchbase\nCouchbase (originally known as Membase) is another NoSQL document database made for realtime applications.\nIt uses the N1QL query language which is more SQL like compared to other NoSQL query languages. In theory you can achieve replication of a Couchbase with a PouchDB database, but this has shown to be not that easy.\nCloudant\nCloudant is a cloud-based service that is based on CouchDB and has mostly the same features.\nIt was originally designed for cloud computing where data can automatically be distributed between servers. But it can also be used to replicate with frontend PouchDB instances to create scalable web applications.\nIt was bought by IBM in 2014 and since 2018 the Cloudant Shared Plan is retired and migrated to IBM Cloud.\nHoodie\nHoodie is a backend solution that enables offline-first JavaScript frontend development without having to write backend code. Its main goal is to abstract away configuration into simple calls to the Hoodie API.\nIt uses CouchDB in the backend and PouchDB in the frontend to enable offline-first capabilities.\nThe last commit for hoodie was one year ago and the website (hood.ie) is offline which indicates it is not an active project anymore.\nLokiJS\nLokiJS is a JavaScript embeddable, in-memory database. And because everything is handled in-memory, LokiJS has awesome performance when mutating or querying data. You can still persist to a permanent storage (IndexedDB, Filesystem etc.) with one of the provided storage adapters. The persistence happens after a timeout is reached after a write, or before the JavaScript process exits. This also means you could loose data when the JavaScript process exits ungracefully like when the power of the device is shut down or the browser crashes.\nWhile the project is not that active anymore, it is more finished then unmaintained.\nRxDB supports using LokiJS as RxStorage.\nGundb\nGUN is a JavaScript graph database. While having many features, the decentralized replication is the main unique selling point. You can replicate data Peer-to-Peer without any centralized backend server. GUN has several other features that are useful on top of that, like encryption and authentication.\nWhile testing it was really hard to get basic things running. GUN is open source, but because of how the source code is written, it is very difficult to understand what is going wrong.\nsql.js\nsql.js is a javascript library to run SQLite on the web. It uses a virtual database file stored in memory and does not have any persistence. All data is lost once the JavaScript process exits. sql.js is created by compiling SQLite to WebAssembly so it has about the same features as SQLite. For older browsers there is a JavaScript fallback.\nabsurd-sQL\nAbsurd-sql is a project that implements an IndexedDB-based persistence for sql.js. Instead of directly writing data into the IndexedDB, it treats IndexedDB like a disk and stores data in blocks there which shows to have a much better performance, mostly because of how performance expensive IndexedDB transactions are.\nNeDB\nNeDB was a embedded persistent or in-memory database for Node.js, nw.js, Electron and browsers.\nIt is document-oriented and had the same query syntax as MongoDB. \nLike LokiJS it has persistence adapters for IndexedDB etc. to persist the database state on the disc.\nThe last commit to NeDB was in 2016.\nDexie.js\nDexie.js is a minimalistic wrapper for IndexedDB. While providing a better API then plain IndexedDB, Dexie also improves performance by batching transactions and other optimizations. It also ads additional non-IndexedDB features like observable queries or multi tab support or react hooks.\nCompared to RxDB, Dexie.js does not support complex (MongoDB-like) queries and requires a lot of fiddling when a document range of a specific index must be fetched.\nDexie.js is used by Whatsapp Web, Microsoft To Do and Github Desktop.\nRxDB supports using Dexie.js as RxStorage which enhances IndexedDB with RxDB features like MongoDB-like queries etc.\nMongoDB Realm\nOriginally Realm was a mobile database for Android and iOS. Later they added support for other languages and runtimes, also for JavaScript. \nIt was meant as replacement for SQLite but is more like an object store then a full SQL database.\nIn 2019 MongoDB bought Realm and changed the projects focus.\nNow Realm is made for replication with the MongoDB Realm Sync based on the MongoDB Atlas Cloud platform.\nApollo\nThe Apollo GraphQL platform is made to transfer data between a server to UI applications over GraphQL endpoints. It contains several tools like GraphQL clients in different languages or libraries to create GraphQL endpoints.\nWhile it is has different caching features for offline usage, compared to RxDB it is not fully offline first because caching alone does not mean your application is fully usable when the user is offline.\nRead further\n\nOffline First Database Comparison\nhttps://jaredforsyth.com/tags/local-first/\n\n"},"questions-answers.html":{"url":"questions-answers.html","title":"Questions & Answers","keywords":"","body":"Questions and answers\nCan't change the schema\nWhen you make changes to the schema of a collection, you sometimes can get an error like\nError: addCollections(): another instance created this collection with a different schema.\nThis means you have created a collection before and added document-data to it.\nWhen you now just change the schema, it is likely that the new schema does not match the saved documents inside of the collection.\nThis would cause strange bugs and would be hard to debug, so RxDB check's if your schema has changed and throws an error.\nTo change the schema in production-mode, do the following steps:\n\nIncrease the version by 1\nAdd the appropriate migrationStrategies so the saved data will be modified to match the new schema\n\nIn development-mode, the schema-change can be simplified by one of these strategies:\n\nUse the memory-storage so your db resets on restart and your schema is not saved permanently\nCall removeRxDatabase('mydatabasename', RxStorage); before creating a new RxDatabase-instance\nAdd a timestamp as suffix to the database-name to create a new one each run like name: 'heroesDB' + new Date().getTime()\n\n"},"contribute.html":{"url":"contribute.html","title":"Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Contribution\nWe are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community.\nDeveloping\nRequirements\nBefore you can start developing, do the following:\n\nMake sure you have installed nodejs with the version stated in the .nvmrc\nClone the repository git clone https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb.git\nInstall the dependencies cd rxdb && npm install\nMake sure that the tests work for you npm run test\n\nFlow\nWhile developing you should run npm run dev and leave it open in the console.

This is done. RxDB has now multiple RxStorage implementations, a better query planner and an improved test suite to ensure everything works correct.\nThis let to huge improvements in write and query performance and decreased the initial pageload of RxDB based applications.\nIn the new major version 13.0.0, to focus was set to improvements to the replication protocol.\nWhen I first implemented the GraphQL replication a few years ago, I had a specific use case in mind and designed the whole protocol and replication plugins around that use case.\nBut the time has shown, that the old replication protocol is a big downside of RxDB:\n\nThe replication relied on the backend to solve all conflicts. This was easy to implement into RxDB because the whole     responsibility was given away to the person that has to implement a compatible backend.\nIn each point in time, the replication did either push or pull documents, but never in parallel. This slows done the whole replication process and makes RxDB not usable for the implementation of features like multi-user-real-time-collaboration or when many read- and write operations have to happen in a short timespan.\nAfter each push, a pull had to be run to check if the backend had changed the state to solve a conflict.\nThe replication protocol did not support attachments and was not designed to ever support them.\n\nSo in version 13.0.0 I replaced the whole replication plugins with a new replication protocol. The main goals have been:\n\nPush- and Pull in parallel.\nUse the data in the changestream (optional) to decrease replication latency.\nImplement the conflict resolution into RxDB so that the client resolves its own conflicts and does not rely on the backend.\nDecrease the complexity for a compatible backend implementation. The new protocol relies on a dumb backend. This will open compatibility with many other use cases like implementing Offline-First in Supabase or using CouchDB but having a faster replication compared to the native CouchDB replication.\nMake it possible to use CRDTs instead of a conflict resolution.\nDesign a the protocol in a way to make it possible to add attachments replication in the future.\n\nOn the RxDocument level, the replication works like git, where the fork/client contains all new writes and must be merged with the master/server before it can push its new state to the master/server.\nA---B1---C1---X    master/server state\n     \\       /\n      B1---C2      fork/client state\nFor more details, read the documentation about the new replication protocol.\nBackends that have been compatible with the previous RxDB versions 12 and older, will not work with the new replication protocol. To learn how to do that, either read the docs or check out the GraphQL example.\nOther breaking changes\n\nRENAMED the ajv-validate plugin to validate-ajv to be in equal with the other validation plugins.\nThe is-my-json-valid validation is no longer supported until this bug is fixed.\n\nREFACTORED the schema validation plugins, they are no longer plugins but now they get wrapped around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows us to run the validation inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows us to configure which RxDatabase instance must use the validation and which does not. In production it often makes sense to validate user data, but you might not need the validation for data that is only replicated from the backend.\n\n\nREFACTORED the key compression plugin, it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows to run the key-compression inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\n\n\nREFACTORED the encryption plugin, it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.\n\nIt allows to run the encryption inside of a Worker RxStorage instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.\nIt allows do use asynchronous crypto function like WebCrypto\n\n\nStore the password hash in the same write request as the database token to improve performance.\n\nREMOVED support for temporary documents see here\n\nREMOVED RxDatabase.broadcastChannel The broadcast channel has been moved out of the RxDatabase and is part of the RxStorage. So it is not longer exposed via RxDatabase.broadcastChannel.\n\n\n\nRemoved the liveInterval option of the replication plugins. It was an edge case feature with wrong defaults. If you want to run the pull replication on interval, you can send a RESYNC event manually in a loop.\n\nREPLACED RxReplicationPullError and RxReplicationPushError with normal RxError like in the rest of the RxDB code.\n\nREMOVED the option to filter out replication documents with the push/pull modifiers #2552 because this does not work with the new replication protocol.\nCHANGE default of replication live to be set to true. Because most people want to do a live replication, not a one time replication.\n\nRENAMED the server plugin is now called server-couchdb and RxDatabase.server() is now RxDatabase.serverCouchDB()\n\nCHANGED Attachment data is now always handled as Blob because Node.js does support Blob since version 18.0.0 so we no longer have to use a Buffer but instead can use Blob for browsers and Node.js\n\nREFACTORED the layout of RxChangeEvent to better match the RxDB requirements and to fix the 'deleted-document-is-modified-but-still-deleted' bug.\n\n\nWhen used with Node.js, RxDB now requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher.\nOther non breaking or internal changes\n\nREMOVED many unused plugin hooks because they decreased the performance.\nREMOVE RxStorageStatics .hash and .hashKey\nCHANGE removed default usage of md5 as default hashing. Use a faster non-cryptographic hash instead.\nADD option to pass a custom hash function when calling createRxDatabase.\n\n\nCHANGE use Float instead of Int to represent timestamps in GraphQL.\n\nFIXED multiple problems with encoding attachments data. We now use the js-base64 library which properly handles utf-8/binary/ascii transformations.\n\nIn the RxDB internal _meta.lwt field, we now use 2 decimals number of the unix timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nADDED checkpointSchema to the RxStorage.statics interface.\n\nNew Features\n\nADDED the websocket replication plugin\nADDED the FoundationDB RxStorage\n\nMigration to the new version\nStored data of the previous RxDB versions is not compatible with RxDB 13.0.0. So if you want to keep that data, you have to migrate it in a way. For most use cases you might want to just drop the data from the client and re-sync it again from the backend. To keep the data locally, you might want to use the storage migration plugin.\n"},"releases/12.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/12.0.0.html","title":"12.0.0","keywords":"","body":"RxDB 12.0.0\nFor the last few months, I worked hard on the new RxDB version 12 release. I mostly focused on performance related features and refactored much of the code.\nRemoved the core plugin\nIn the past, RxDB exported all bundled plugins when doing import from 'rxdb';.\nThis increased the bundle size, so optionally people could import from 'rxdb/plugins/core'; to create a custom build that only contains the plugin that they really need.\nBut very often this lead to accidental imports of 'rxdb'. For example, when the code editor auto imported methods.\nSo now, the default import from 'rxdb'; only exports RxDB core. Every plugin must be imported afterwards if needed.\nUnified the replication primitives and the GraphQL replication plugin\nMost of the GraphQL replication code has been replaced by using the replication primitives plugin internally.\nThis means many bugs and undefined behavior that was already fixed in the replication primitives, are now also fixed in the GraphQL replication.\nAlso, the GraphQL replication now runs push in bulk. This means you either have to update your backend to accept bulk mutations, or set push.batchSize: 1 and transform the array into a single document inside push.queryBuilder().\nAdded the cleanup plugin\nTo make replication work, and for other reasons, RxDB has to keep deleted documents in storage.\nThis ensures that when a client is offline, the deletion state is still known and can be replicated with the backend when the client goes online again.\nKeeping too many deleted documents in the storage can slow down queries or fill up too much disk space.\nWith the cleanup plugin, RxDB will run cleanup cycles that clean up deleted documents when it can be done safely.\nAllow to set a specific index\nBy default, the query will be sent to RxStorage, where a query planner will determine which one of the available indexes must be used.\nBut the query planner cannot know everything and sometimes will not pick the most optimal index.\nTo improve query performance, you can specify which index must be used, when running the query.\nconst queryResults = await myCollection\n    .find({\n      selector: {\n        age: {\n          $gt: 18\n        },\n        gender: {\n          $eq: 'm'\n        }\n      },\n      /**\n       * Because the developer knows that 50% of the documents are 'male',\n       * but only 20% are below age 18,\n       * it makes sense to enforce using the ['gender', 'age'] index to improve performance.\n       * This could not be known by the query planner which might have chosen ['age', 'gender'] instead.\n       */\n      index: ['gender', 'age']\n    }).exec();\n\nEnforce primaryKey in the index\nFor various performance optimizations, like the EventReduce algorithm, RxDB needs a deterministic sort order for all query results.\nTo ensure a deterministic sorting, RxDB now automatically adds the primary key as last sort attribute to every query, if it is not there already. This ensures that all documents that have the same attributes on all query relevant fields, still can be sorted in a deterministic way, not depending on which was written first to the database.\nIn the past, this often lead to slow queries, because indexes where not constructed with that in mind.\nNow RxDB will add the primaryKey to all indexes that do not contain it already.\nIf you have any collection with a custom index set, you need to run a migration when updating to RxDB version 12.0.0 so that RxDB can rebuild the indexes.\nFields that are used in indexes need some meta attributes\nWhen using a schema with indexes, depending on the field type, you must have set some meta attributes like maxLength or minimum. This is required so that RxDB\nis able to know the maximum string representation length of a field, which is needed to craft custom indexes on several RxStorage implementations.\nconst schemaWithIndexes = {\n  version: 0,\n  primaryKey: 'id',\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string',\n          maxLength: 100 // \nIntroduce _meta field\nIn the past, RxDB used a hacky way to mark documents as being from the remote instance during replication.\nThis is needed to ensure that pulled documents are not sent to the backend again.\nRxDB crafted a specific revision string and stored the data with that string.\nThis meant that it was not possible to replicate with multiple endpoints at the same time.\nFrom now on, all document data is stored with an _meta field that can contain various flags and other values.\nThis makes it easier for plugins to remember stuff that belongs to the document.\nIn the future, the other meta fields like _rev, _deleted and _attachments will be moved from the root level\nto the _meta field. This is not done in release 12.0.0 to ensure that there is a migration path.\nRemoved RxStorage RxKeyObjectInstance\nIn the past, we stored local documents and internal data in a RxStorageKeyObjectInstance of the RxStorage interface.\nIn PouchDB, this has a slight performance improvement compared to storing that data in 'normal' documents because it does not have to handle the revision tree.\nBut this improved performance is only possible because normal document handling on PouchDB is so slow.\nFor every other RxStorage implementation, it does not really mather if documents are stored in a query-able way or not. Therefore, the whole RxStorageKeyObjectInstance is removed. Instead, RxDB now stores local documents and internal data in normal storage instances. This removes complexity and makes things easier in the future. For example, we could now migrate local documents or query them in plugins.\nRefactor plugin hooks\nIn the past, an RxPlugin could add plugins hooks which where always added as last.\nThis meant that some plugins depended on having the correct order when calling addRxPlugin().\nNow each plugin hook can be either defined as before or after to specify at which position of the current hooks\nthe new hook must be added.\nLocal documents must be activated per RxDatabase/RxCollection\nFor better performance, the local document plugin does not create a storage for every database or collection that is created.\nInstead, you have to set localDocuments: true when you want to store local documents in the instance.\n// activate local documents on a RxDatabase\nconst myDatabase = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStoragePouch('memory'),\n    localDocuments: true // \nAdded Memory RxStorage\nThe Memory RxStorage is based on plain in-memory arrays and objects. It can be used in all environments and is made for performance.\nRxDB Premium\nYou can now purchase access to additional RxDB plugins that are part of the RxDB Premium package.\nIf you have sponsored RxDB in the past (before the April 2022), you can get free lifetime access to RxDB Premium by writing me via Twitter\n\nRxStorage IndexedDB a really fast RxStorage implementation based on IndexedDB. Made to be used in browsers.\nRxStorage SQLite a really fast RxStorage implementation based on SQLite. Made to be used on Node.js, Electron, React Native, Cordova or Capacitor.\nRxStorage Sharding a wrapper around any other RxStorage that improves performance by applying the sharding technique.\nmigrateRxDBV11ToV12 A plugin that migrates data from any RxDB v11 storage to a new RxDB v12 database. Use this when you upgrade from RxDB 11->12 and you have to keep your database state.\n\nOther changes\n\nThe Dexie.js RxStorage is no longer in beta mode.\nAdded RxDocument().toMutableJSON()\nAdded RxCollection().bulkUpsert()\nAdded optional init() function to RxPlugin.\ndev-mode: Add check to ensure all top-level fields in a query are defined in the schema.\nSupport for array field based indexes like data.[].subfield was removed, as it anyway never really worked.\nRefactored the usage of RxCollection.storageInstance to ensure all hooks run properly.\nRefactored the encryption plugin so no more plugin specific code is in the RxDB core.\nRemoved the encrypted export from the json-import-export plugin. This was barely used and made everything more complex. All exports are now non-encrypted. If you need them encrypted, you can still run by encryption after the export is done.\nRxPlugin hooks now can be defined as running before or after other plugin hooks.\nAttachments are now internally handled as string instead of Blob or Buffer\nFix (replication primitives) only drop pulled documents when a relevant document was changed locally.\nFix dexie.js was not able to query over an index when keyCompression: true\n\nChanges to RxStorageInterface:\n\nRxStorageInstance must have the RxStorage in the storage property.\nThe _deleted field is now required for each data interaction with RxStorage.\nRemoved RxStorageInstance.getChangedDocuments() and added RxStorageInstance.getChangedDocumentsSince() for better performance.\nAdded doesBroadcastChangestream() to RxStorageStatics\nAdded withDeleted parameter to RxStorageKeyObjectInstance.findLocalDocumentsById()\nAdded internal _meta property to stored document data that contains internal document related data like last-write-time and replication checkpoints.\n\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not have the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.\nReview the code and add tests. I am only a single human with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nImprove the documentation. In the last user survey, many users told me that the documentation is not good enough. But I reviewed the docs and could not find clear flaws. The problem is that I am way too deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\nHelp the next PouchDB release to improve RxDBs performance.\n\nDiscuss!\nPlease discuss here.\n"},"releases/11.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/11.0.0.html","title":"11.0.0","keywords":"","body":"11.0.0\nThe last major release was only about 6 month ago. But to further improve RxDB, it was necessary to make some more breaking changes and release the next major version.\nIn the last version 10.0.0 the storage layer was abstracted in a way to make it possible to not only use PouchDB as storage, but instead we can use different storage engines like the one based on LokiJS or any custom implementation of the RxStorage interface.\nIn the new version 11.0.0 the focus is on making it possible to put the RxStorage into a WebWorker to take CPU load from the main process into the worker's process. This can improve the perceived performance of your application, especially when you have to handle many documents or when you need the main process CPU cycles to manage the DOM with your frontend framework.\nWorker plugin\nPerformance was always something RxDB had a struggle with. Not because RxDB itself is slow, but because the underlying storage engine (mostly PouchDB) or IndexedDB is slow. This never was a problem for 'normal' applications that have to store some documents. But on big applications with much data, there was a bottleneck.\nWith the Worker plugin, you can move the RxStorage out of the main JavaScript process. This makes it pretty easy to utilize more then one CPU core and speed up your application.\n// worker.ts\nimport { wrappedRxStorage } from 'rxdb/plugins/worker';\nimport { getRxStorageLoki } from 'rxdb/plugins/lokijs';\nwrappedRxStorage({\n    storage: getRxStorageLoki()\n});\n\n// main process\nimport { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb/plugins/core';\nimport { getRxStorageWorker } from 'rxdb/plugins/worker';\nconst database = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStorageWorker(\n        {\n            statics: RxStorageLokiStatics,\n            workerInput: 'path/to/worker.js'\n        }\n    )\n});\n\nThe whole documentation about the worker plugin can be found here.\nTranspile async/await to promises instead of generators\nThe RxDB source-code is transpiled from TypeScript to es5/es6 JavaScript code via babel.\nIn the past we transpiled the async and await keywords with the babel plugin plugin-transform-async-to-generator.\nNow we use the babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises plugin instead.\nIt transpiles asnyc/await into native Promises instead of using JavaScript generators. This has shown to decrease build size by about 10% and also improves the performance.\nRemoved deprecated recieved methods\nIn the past there was a typo in all getters and methods that are called recieved.\nThis was renamed to received and all misstyped methods have been deprecated.\nWe now removed all deprecated methods, so you have to use the correctly spelled methods instead.\nSee #3392\nAll internal events are handled as bulks\nAll events that are generated from writing to the storage instance are now handled in bulks instead of each event for its own. This has shown to save performance when the events are send over a data layer like a WebWorker or the BroadcastChannel. This change only affects you if you have created custom RxDB plugins.\nRxStorage interface changes\nTo make the RxStorage abstraction compatible with Webworkers, we had to do some changes. These will only affect you if you use a custom RxStorage implementation.\n\nThe non async functions prepareQuery, getSortComparator and getQueryMatcher have been moved out of RxStorageInstance into the statics property of RxStorage. This makes it possible to split the code when using the worker plugin. You only need to load the static methods at the main process, and the whole storage engine is only loaded inside of the worker.\nAll data communication with the RxStorage now happens only via plain JSON objects. Instead of returning a JavaScript Map or Set, only JSON datatypes are allowed. This makes it easier to properly serialize the data when transferring it over to or from a WebWorker.\nEvents that are created from a write operation, must be emitted before the write operation resolves. This ensures that RxDB always knows about all events before it runs another operation. So when you do an insert and a query directly after the insert, the query will return the correct results.\nThe meta data digest and length of attachments is now created by RxDB, not by the RxStorage. #3548\nAdded the statics hashKey property to identify the used hash function.\n\nRemoved the no-validate plugin.\nIn the past, RxDB required you to add one schema validation plugin. For production, it was useful to not have any schema validation for better performance and a smaller build size. For that, the no-validate plugin could be added which was just a dummy plugin that did no do any validation. To remove this unnecessary complexity, RxDB no longer requires you to add a validation plugin. Therefore the no-validate plugin is now removed as it is no longer needed.\nOther changes\n\nThe LokiJS RxStorage no longer uses the IdleQueue to determine if the database is idle. Because LokiJS is in-memory, we can just wait for CPU idleness via requestIdleCallback()\nBugfix: Do not throw an error when database is destroyed while a GraphQL replication is running.\nCompound primary key migration throws \"Value of primary key(s) cannot be changed\" #3546 Thanks @nothingkid\nAllow _id as primaryKey #3562 Thanks @SuperKirik\nLokiJS: Remote operations do never resolve when remote instance was leader and died.\n\nMigration from 10.x.x\nThe migration should be pretty easy. Nothing in the datalayer has been changed, so you can use the stored data of v10 together with the new v11 RxDB.\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not had the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.\nReview the code and add tests. I am only a single human with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nImprove the documentation. In the last user survey many users told me that the documentation is not good enough. But I reviewed the docs and could not find clear flaws. The problem is that I am way to deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\n\nDiscuss!\nPlease discuss here.\n"},"releases/10.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/10.0.0.html","title":"10.0.0","keywords":"","body":"10.0.0\nOne year after version 9.0.0 we now have RxDB version 10.0.0.\nThe main goal of version 10 was to change things that make RxDB ready for the future.\nNotice that I use major releases to bundle stuff that breaks the RxDB usage in your project, not to add new features.\nThe main thing first\nIn the past, RxDB was build around Pouchdb. Before I started making RxDB I tried to solve the problems of my current project with other existing databases out there. I evaluated all of them and then started using Pouchdb and added many features via plugin. Then I realised it will be easier to create a separate project that wraps around Pouchdb, that was RxDB. Back then pouchdb was the most major browser database out there and it was well maintained and had a big community.\nBut in the last 5 years, things have changed. A big part of the RxDB users do not use couchdb in the backend and do not need the couchdb replication.\nTherefore they do not really need the overhead with revision handling that slows down the performance of pouchdb. Also there where many other problems with using pouchdb. It is not actively developed, many bugs are not fixed and no new features get added. Also there are many unsolved problems like how to finally delete document data or how to replicate more then 6 databases at the same time, how to use replication without attachments data, and so on...\nSo for this release, I abstracted all parts that we use from pouchdb into the RxStorage interface. RxDB works on top of any implementation of the RxStorage interface. This means it is now possible to use RxDB together with other underlying storages like SQLite, PostgreSQL, Minimongo, MongoDB, and so on, as long as someone writes the RxStorage class for it.\nThis means, to create a RxDatabase you have to pass the storage class instead of pouchdb specific settings:\n\n// import pouchdb specific stuff and add pouchdb adapters\nimport {\n    addPouchPlugin,\n    getRxStoragePouch\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';\n\n// IMPORTANT: Do not use addRxPlugin to add pouchdb adapter, instead use addPouchPlugin\naddPouchPlugin(require('pouchdb-adapter-memory'));\n\nimport {\n    addRxPlugin,\n    createRxDatabase,\n    randomCouchString,\n} from 'rxdb/plugins/core';\n\n// create the database with the storage creator.\nconst db = await createRxDatabase({\n    name: 'mydatabase',\n    storage: getRxStoragePouch('memory'),\n});\n\nTo access the internal pouch instance of a collection, you have to go over the storageInstance:\nconst pouch = myRxCollection.storageInstance.internals.pouch;\n\nOther breaking changes\nPrimary key is required\nIn the past, using a primary key was optional. When no primary key was defined, RxDB filled up the _id field with an uuid-like string which was then used as primary. When I researched on github how people use RxDB, I found out that many use a secondary index for what should be the primary key.\nAlso having the primary key optional, caused much confusing when using RxDB with typescript.\nSo now the primary key MUST be set when creating a schema for RxDB.\nAlso the primary key is defined with the primaryKey property at the top level of the schema. This ensures that typescript will complain if no primaryKey is defined.\n\n// when using the type `RxJsonSchema` the `DocType` is now required\nconst mySchema: RxJsonSchema = {\n    version: 0,\n    primaryKey: 'passportId',\n    type: 'object',\n    properties: {\n        passportId: {\n            type: 'string'\n        }\n    },\n    // primaryKey is always required\n    required: ['passportId']\n}\n\nAttachment data must be Blob or Buffer\nIn the past, an RxAttachment could be stored with Blob, Buffer and string data. If a string was passed, pouchdb internally transformed the data to a Blob or Buffer, depending on in which environment it is running.\nThis behavior caused much trouble and weird edge cases because of how the data is transformed from and to string.\nSo now you can only store Blob or Buffer as attachment data. string is no longer allowed. You can still transform a string to a Blob or Buffer by yourself and then store it.\nimport { blobBufferUtil } from 'rxdb';\n\nconst attachment = await myDocument.putAttachment(\n    {\n        id: 'cat.txt',\n        data: blobBufferUtil.createBlobBuffer('miau', 'text/plain')\n        type: 'text/plain'\n    }\n);\n\nAlso putAttachment() now defaults to skipIfSame=true. This means when you write attachment data that already is exactly the same in the database, no write will be done.\nOutgoing data is now readonly and deep-frozen\nRxDB often uses outgoing data also in the internals. For example the result of a query is not only send to the user, but also used inside of RxDB's query-change-detection. To ensure that mutation of the outgoing data is not changing internal stuff, which would cause strange bugs, outgoing data was always deep-cloned before handing it out to the user. This is a common practice on many javascript libraries.\nThe problem is that deep-cloning big objects can be very CPU/Memory expensive. So instead of doing a deep-clone, RxDB does now assume that outgoing data is immutable. If the users wants to modify that data, it has be be deep-cloned by the user.\nTo ensure immutability, RxDB runs a deep-freeze in the dev-mode (about same expensive as deep clone). Also typescript will throw a build-time error because we use ReadonlyArray and readonly to define outgoing data immutable. In production-mode, there will be nothing besides typescript that ensures immutability to have best performance.\nconst data = myRxDocument.toJSON();\ndata.foo = bar; // This does NOT work!\n\n// instead clone the data before changing it\nimport { clone } from 'rxjs';\nconst clonedData = clone(data);\ndata.foo = bar; // This works!\n\nThe in-memory plugin does no longer work.\nThe in-memory plugin was used to spawn in-memory collections on top of a normal RxCollection. The benefit is to have the data replicated into the memory of the javascript runtime, which allows for faster queries.\nAfter doing many tests and observations, I found out that the in-memory plugin was slow. Really slow, even slower then just using the indexeddb adapter in the browser. You can reproduce my observations at the event-reduce testpage. Here you can see that random-writes+query are slower on the memory-adapter then on indexeddb.\nThe reason for this are the big abstraction layers. Pouchdb uses the adapter system. The memory adapter uses the leveldown abstraction layer. Each write/read goes to the memdown module.\nSo the in-memory plugin is not working for now. In the future it will be reimplemented in a custom memory based RxStorage class.\nNotice: You can of course still use the pouchdb memory adapter as usual. It is not affected by this change.\nWhat else is a breaking change?\n\nRemoved the deprecated atomicSet(), use atomicPatch() instead.\nRemoved the deprecated RxDatabase.collection() use RxDatabase().addCollections() instead.\nRemoved plugin hook preCreatePouchDb because it is no longer needed.\nRemoved the watch-for-changes plugin. We now overwrite pouchdbs bulkDocs method to generate events. This is faster and more reliable.\nRemoved the adapter-check plugin. (The function adapterCheck is move to the pouchdb plugin).\nCalling RxDatabase.server() now returns a promise that resolves when the server is started up.\nChanged the defaults of PouchDBExpressServerOptions from the server() method, by default we now store logs in the tmp folder and the config is in memory.\nRenamed replication-plugin to replication-couchdb to be more consistent in naming like with replication-graphql\nFor the same reason, renamed RxCollection().sync() to RxCollection().syncCouchDB()\n\n\nRenamed the functions of the json import/export plugin to be less confusing.\ndump() is now exportJSON()\nimportDump() is now importJSON()\n\n\nRxCollection uses a separate pouchdb instance for local documents, so that they can persist during migrations.\nA JsonSchema must have the required array at the top level and it must contain the primary key.\n\nNew features\nComposite primary key\nYou can now use a composite primary key for the schema where you can join different properties of the document data to create a primary key.\nconst mySchema = {\n  keyCompression: true, // set this to true, to enable the keyCompression\n  version: 0,\n  title: 'human schema with composite primary',\n  primaryKey: {\n      // where should the composed string be stored\n      key: 'id',\n      // fields that will be used to create the composed key\n      fields: [\n          'firstName',\n          'lastName'\n      ],\n      // separator which is used to concat the fields values.\n      separator: '|'\n  }\n  type: 'object',\n  properties: {\n      id: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      firstName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      },\n      lastName: {\n          type: 'string'\n      }\n  },\n  required: [\n    'id', \n    'firstName',\n    'lastName'\n  ]\n};\n\nFor the future\nWith these changes, RxDB is now ready for the future plans:\n\nI want to replace the revision handling of documents with conflict resolution strategies that can always directly resolve conflicts instead of maintaining the revision tree.\nImplement different implementations for RxStorage. I will first work on a memory based version. I am in good hope that the community will create other implementations depending on their needs.\n\nYou can help!\nThere are many things that can be done by you to improve RxDB:\n\nCheck the BACKLOG for features that would be great to have.\nCheck the breaking backlog for breaking changes that must be implemented in the future but where I did not had the time yet.\nCheck the TODOs in the code. There are many small improvements that can be done for performance and build size.\nReview the code and add tests. I am only a single dude with a laptop. My code is not perfect and much small improvements can be done when people review the code and help me to clarify undefined behaviors.\nImprove the documentation. In the last user survey many users told me that the documentation is not good enough. But I reviewed the docs and could not find clear flaws. The problem is that I am way to deep into RxDB so that I am not able to understand which documentation a newcomer to the project needs. Likely I assume too much knowledge or focus writing about the wrong parts.\nUpdate the example projects many of them are outdated and need updates.\n\nDiscuss!\nPlease discuss here.\n"},"releases/9.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/9.0.0.html","title":"9.0.0","keywords":"","body":"9.0.0\nSo I was working hard the past month to prepare everything for the next major release of RxDB. The last major release was 1,5 years ago by the way.\nWhen I started listing up the planned changes I had big ambitions about basically rewriting everything. But I found out this time has not come yet. There is some work to be done first. So version 9.0.0 was more about fixing all these small things that made improving the codebase difficult. Much has been refactored and moved. Some API-parts have been changed to have a more simple project with a cleaner codebase.\nNotice that I use major releases to bundle stuff that breaks the RxDB usage in your project. By having only few major releases you can be sure that you can upgrade in one big block instead of changing stuff each few months. Big features are released in non-major releases because they mostly can be implemented without side effects.\nBreaking changes\nYou have to apply these changes to your codebase when upgrading RxDB.\nAll default exports have been removed\nUsing default exports and imports can be helpful when you want to write code fast.\nBut using them also disabled the tree-shaking of your bundler which means you added much code to your bundle that was not even used. To prevent this common behavior, I removed all default exports and renamed functions so that they are more unlikely to clash with other non-RxDB function names.\nInstead of doing\nimport RxDB from 'rxdb';\nRxDB.plugin(/* ... */);\nawait RxDB.create({/* ... */});\n\nYou now do\nimport { createRxDatabase, addRxPlugin } from 'rxdb';\naddRxPlugin(/* ... */);\nawait createRxDatabase({/* ... */});\n\nAlso removeDatabase() is renamed to removeRxDatabase() and plugin() is now addRxPlugin().\nSame goes for all previous default exports of the plugins.\nIndexes are specified at the top level of the schema definition\nrelated issue\nIn the past the indexes of a collection had to be specified at the field level of the schema like \n{\n    \"firstName\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"index\": true\n    }    \n}\n\nThis made it complex to list up the index fields which had a bad performance on startup.\nTo fix this the indexes are now specified at the top level of the schema like\n{\n    \"title\": \"my schema\",\n    \"version\": 0,\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"indexes\": [\n        \"firstName\",\n        [\"compound\", \"index\"]\n    ]\n}\n\nEncrypted fields at the top level of the schema\nSame as the indexes, encrypted fields are now also defined in the top level like\n{\n    \"title\": \"my schema\",\n    \"version\": 0,\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"encrypted\": [\n        \"password\"\n    ]\n}\n\nNew dev-mode plugin\nIn the past we had stuff that is only wanted for development in the two plugins error-messages and schema-check.\nNow we have a single plugin dev-mode that contains all these checks and development helper functions. I also moved many other checks out of the core-module into dev-mode.\nimport { RxDBDevModePlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/dev-mode';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBDevModePlugin);\n\nNew migration plugin\nThe data migration was not used by all users of this project. Often it was easier to just wipe the local data store and let the client sync everything from the server. Because the migration has so much code, it is now in a separate plugin so that you do not have to ship this code to the clients if not necessary.\nimport { RxDBMigrationPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/migration';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBMigrationPlugin);\n\nRewritten key-compression\nThe key-compression logic was fully coded only for RxDB. This was a problem because it was not usable for other stuff and also badly tested. We had a known problem with nested arrays that caused much confusion because some queries did not find the correct documents.\nI now created a npm-package jsonschema-key-compression that has cleaner code, better tests and can also be used for non-RxDB stuff.\nIf you used the key-compression in the past and have clients out there with old data, you have to find a way to migrate that data by using the json-import or other solutions depending on your project.\nRewritten query-change-detection to event-reduce\nOne big benefit of having a realtime database is that big performance optimizations can be done when the database knows a query is observed and the updated results are needed continuously. In the past this optimization was done by the internal queryChangeDetection which was a big tree of if-else-statements that hopefully worked. This was also the reason why queryChangeDetection was in beta mode and not enabled by default.\nAfter months of research and testing I was able to create Event-Reduce: An algorithm to optimize database queries that run multiple times. This JavaScript module contains an algorithm that is able to optimize realtime queries in a way that was not possible before. The algorithm is not RxDB specific and also heavily tested.\nInstead of setting queryChangeDetection when creating a RxDatabase, you now set eventReduce which defaults to true.\nfind() and findOne() now accepts the full mango query\nIn the past, only the selector of a query could be passed to find() and findOne() if you wanted to also do sort, skip or limit, you had to call additional functions like\nconst query = myRxCollection.find({\n    age: {\n        $gt: 10\n    }\n}).sort('name').skip(5).limit(10);\n\nNow you can pass the full query to the function call like \nconst query = myRxCollection.find({\n    selector: {\n        age: {\n            $gt: 10\n        }\n    },\n    sort: [{name: 'asc'}],\n    skip: 5,\n    limit: 10\n});\n\nmoved query builder to own plugin\nThe query builder that allowed to create queries like .where('foo').eq('bar') etc. was not really used by many people. Most of the time it is better to just pass the full query as simple json object. Also the code for the query builder was big and increased the build size much more then its value added. Only some edge-cases where recursive query modification was needed made the query builder useful. If you still want to use the query builder, you have to import the plugin.\nimport { RxDBQueryBuilderPlugin } from 'rxdb/plugins/query-builder';\naddRxPlugin(RxDBQueryBuilderPlugin);\n\nRefactored RxChangeEvent\nThe whole data structure of RxChangeEvent was way more complicated than it had to be. I refactored the whole class to be more simple. If you directly use RxChangeEvent in your project you have to adapt to these changes. Also the stream of RxDatabase().$ will no longer emit the COLLECTION event when a new collection is created.\nInternal hash() is now using a salt\nThe internal hash function was used to store hashes of database passwords to compare them and directly throw errors when the wrong password was used with an existing data set. This was dangerous because you could use rainbow tables or even just google the hash to find out the plain password. So now the internal hashing is using a salt to prevent these attacks. If you have used the encryption in the past, you have to migrate your internal schema storage.\nChanged default of RxDocument.toJSON()\nBy default RxDocument.toJSON() always returned also the _rev field and the _attachments. This was confusing behavior which is why I changed the default to RxDocument().toJSON(withRevAndAttachments = false)\nTypescript 3.8.0 or newer is required\nBecause RxDB and some subdependencies extensively use export type ... you now need typescript 3.8.0 or newer.\nGraphQL replication will run a schema validation of incoming data\nIn dev-mode, the GraphQL-replication will run a schema validation of each document that comes from the server before it is saved to the database.\nInternal and other changes\nI refactored much internal stuff and moved much code out of the core into the specific plugins.\n\nRenamed RxSchema.jsonID to RxSchema.jsonSchema\nMoved remaining stuff of leader-election from core into the plugin\nMerged multiple internal databases for metadata into one internalStore\nRemoved many runtime type checks that now should be covered by typescript in buildtime\nThe GraphQL replication is now out of beta mode\nRemoved documentation examples for require() CommonJS loading\nRemoved RxCollection.docChanges$() because all events are from the docs\n\nHelp wanted\nRxDB is an open source project an heavily relies on the contribution of its users. There are some things that must be done, but I have no time for them.\nRefactor data-migrator\nThe current implementation has some flaws and should be completely rewritten.\n\nIt does not use pouchdb's bulkDocs which is much faster\nIt could have been written without rxjs and with less code that is easier to understand\nIt does not migrate the revisions of documents which causes a problem when replication is used\n\nAdd e2e tests to the react example\nThe react example has no end-to-end tests which is why the CI does not ensure that it works all the time. We should add some basic tests like we did for the other example projects.\nFix pouchdb bug so we can upgrade pouchdb-find\nThere is a bug in pouchdb that prevents the upgrade of pouchdb-find. This is why RxDB relies on an old version of pouchdb-find that also requires different sub-dependencies. This increases the build size a lot because for example we ship multiple version of spark-md5 and others.\nAbout the future of RxDB\nAt the moment RxDB is a realtime database based on pouchdb. In the future I want RxDB to be a wrapper around pull-based databases that also works with other source-dbs like mongoDB or PostgreSQL. As a start I defined the RxStorage interface and created a RxStoragePouchdb class that implements it and contains all pouchdb-specific logic. I want to move every direct storage usage into that interface so that later we can create other implementations of it for other source databases.\n"},"releases/8.0.0.html":{"url":"releases/8.0.0.html","title":"8.0.0","keywords":"","body":"8.0.0\nWhen I created RxDB, two years ago, there where some things that I did not consider and other things that I just decided wrong.\nWith the breaking version 8.0.0 I rewrote some parts of RxDB and changed the API a bit. The focus laid on better defaults and better performance.\ndisableKeyCompression by default\nBecause the keyCompression was confusing and most users do not use it, it is now disabled by default. Also the naming was bad, so disableKeyCompression is now renamed to keyCompression which defaults to false.\ncollection() now only accepts a RxJsonSchema as schema\nIn the past, it was allowed to set an RxSchema or an RxJsonSchema as schema-field when creating a collection. This was confusing and so it is now only allowed to use RxJsonSchema.\nrequired fields have to be set via array\nIn the past it was allowed to set a field as required by setting the boolean value required: true.\nThis is against the json-schema-standard and will make problems when switching between different schema-validation-plugins. Therefore required fields must now be set via required: ['fieldOne', 'fieldTwo'].\nSetters are only callable on temporary documents\nTo be similar to mongoosejs, there was the possibility to set a documents value via myDoc.foo = 'bar' and later call myDoc.save() to persist these changes.\nBut there was the problem that we have no weak pointers in javascript and therefore we have to store all document-instances in a cache to run change-events on them and make them 'reactive'. To save memory-space, we reuse the same documents when they are used multiple times. This made it hard to determine what happens when multiple parts of an application used the setters at the same time. Also there was an undefined behavior what should happen when a field is changed via setter and also via replication before save() was called.\n\nmyDoc.age = 50;, myDoc.set('age', 50); and myDoc.save() is no more allowed on non-temporary-documents\nInstead, to change document-data, use RxDocument.atomicUpdate() or RxDocument.atomicSet() or RxDocument.update().\nThe following document-methods no longer exist: synced$, resync()\n\nmiddleware-hooks contain plain json as first parameter and RxDocument as second\nWhen the middleware-hooks where created, the goal was to work equal then mongoose. But this is not possible because mongoose is more 'static' and its documents never change their attributes. RxDB is a reactive database and when the state on disc changes, the attributes of the document also change. This caused some undefined behavior especially with async middleware-hooks. To solve this, hooks now can only modify the plain data, not the RxDocument itself.\nmyCollection.preSave(function(data, rxDocument) {\n    // to set age to 50 before saving, change the first parameter\n    data.age = 50;\n}, false);\n\nmultiInstance is now done via broadcast-channel\nBecause the BroadcastChannel-API is not usable in all browsers and also not in NodeJs, multiInstance-communication was hard. The hacky workaround was to use a pseudo-socket and regularly check if an other instance has emitted a RxChangeEvent.\nThis was expensive because even when the database did nothing, we wasted disk-IO and CPU by handling this.\nTo solve this waste, I spend one month creating a module that polyfills the broadcast-channel-api so it works on old browsers, new browsers and even NodeJs. This does not only waste less resources but also has a lower latency. Also the module is used by more projects than RxDB which allows use the fix bugs and improve performance together.\nSet QueryChangeDetection via RxDatabase-option\nIn the past, the QueryChangeDetection had to be enabled by importing the QueryChangeDetection and calling a function on it. This was strange and also did not allow to toggle the QueryChangeDetection on specific databases.\nNow we set the QueryChangeDetection by adding the boolean field queryChangeDetection: true when creating the database.\nconst db = await RxDB.create({\n  name: 'heroesdb',\n  adapter: 'idb',\n  queryChangeDetection: false // \nReuse an RxDocument-protoptye per collection instead of adding getters/setters to each document\nBecause the fields of an RxDocument are defined dynamically by the schema and we could not use the Proxy-Object because it is not supported in IE11, there was one workaround used: Each time a document is created, all getters and setters where applied on it. This was expensive and now we use a different approach.\nOnce per collection, a custom RxDocument-protoptype and constructor is created and each RxDocument of this collection is created with the constructor. This change is a rewrite internally and should not change anything for RxDB-users. If you use RxDB with vuejs, you might get some problems that can be fixed by upgrading vuejs to the latest version.\nRewritten the inMemory-plugin\nThe inMemory-plugin was written with some wrong estimations. I rewrote it and added much more tests. Also awaitPersistence() can now be used to check if all writes have already been replicated into the parent collection. Also RxCollection.watchForChanges() got split out from the replication-plugin into its own watch-for-changes-plugin because it is used in the inMemory and the replication functionality.\nSome comparisons\n(Tested with node 10.6.0 and the memory-adapter, lower is better)\nReproduce with npm run build:size and npm run test:performance\n\n\n\n\n7.7.1\n8.0.0\n\n\n\n\nBundle-Size (Webpack+minify+gzip)\n110 kb\n101.962 kb\n\n\nSpawn 1000 databases  with 5 collections each\n8744 ms\n9906 ms\n\n\ninsert 2000 documents\n8006 ms\n5781 ms\n\n\nfind 10.000 documents\n3202 ms\n1312 ms\n\n\n\n"}}}
