# Storage Migration

The storage migration plugin can be used to migrate all data from one existing RxStorage into another. This is useful when:

- You want to migration from one [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) to another one.
- You want to migrate to a new major RxDB version while keeping the previous saved data.

The storage migration **drops deleted documents** and filters them out during the migration.

**NOTICE:** The storage migration plugin is part of [RxDB premium](./premium.md). It is not part of the default RxDB module.


## Usage

Lets say you want to migrate from PouchDB to the [Dexie.js](./rx-storage-dexie.md) RxStorage.

```ts
import {
    getRxStoragePouch
} from 'rxdb/plugins/pouchdb';
import { getRxStorageDexie } from 'rxdb/plugins/dexie';

// create the new RxDatabase
const db = await createRxDatabase<RxStylechaseCollections>({
    name: dbLocation,
    storage: getRxStorageDexie(),
    multiInstance: false
});

await migrateStorage(
    db as any,
    /**
     * Name of the old database,
     * using the storage migration requires that the
     * new database has a different name.
     */
    'myOldDatabaseName',
    getRxStoragePouch(), // RxStorage of the old database
    500, // batch size
    // 
    (input: AfterMigrateBatchHandlerInput) => {
        console.log('storage migration: batch processed');
    }
);
```


## Migrate from a previous RxDB major version

To migrate from a previous RxDB major version, you have to install the 'old' RxDB in the `package.json`

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "rxdb-old": "npm:rxdb@12.7.16",
    }
}
```

The you can run the migration by providing the old storage:

```ts
/* ... */
import {
    getRxStoragePouch
} from 'rxdb-old/plugins/pouchdb'; // <- import from the old RxDB version

await migrateStorage(
    db as any,
    /**
     * Name of the old database,
     * using the storage migration requires that the
     * new database has a different name.
     */
    'myOldDatabaseName',
    getRxStoragePouch(), // RxStorage of the old database
    500, // batch size
    // 
    (input: AfterMigrateBatchHandlerInput) => {
        console.log('storage migration: batch processed');
    }
);
/* ... */
```
