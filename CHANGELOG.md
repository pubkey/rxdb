# RxDB Changelog

<!-- CHANGELOG NEWEST -->

<!-- ADD new changes here! -->

### 13.0.0-beta.27 (31 August 2022)

- RENAMED the `ajv-validate` plugin to `validate-ajv` to be in equal with the other validation plugins.
- The `is-my-json-valid` validation is no longer supported until [this bug](https://github.com/mafintosh/is-my-json-valid/pull/192) is fixed.
- REFACTORED the [schema validation plugins](./docs-src/schema-validation.md), they are no longer plugins but now they get wrapped around any other RxStorage.
  - It allows us to run the validation inside of a [Worker RxStorage](./docs-src/rx-storage-worker.md) instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.
  - It allows us to configure which `RxDatabase` instance must use the validation and which does not. In production it often makes sense to validate user data, but you might not need the validation for data that is only replicated from the backend.
- REFACTORED the [key compression plugin](./docs-src/key-compression.md), it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.
  - It allows to run the key-comresion inside of a [Worker RxStorage](./docs-src/rx-storage-worker.md) instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.

- REFACTORED the encryption plugin, it is no longer a plugin but now a wrapper around any other RxStorage.
  - It allows to run the encryption inside of a [Worker RxStorage](./docs-src/rx-storage-worker.md) instead of running it in the main JavaScript process.
  - It allows do use asynchronous crypto function like [WebCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
- Store the password hash in the same write request as the database token to improve performance.

- REMOVED many unused plugin hooks because they decreased the performance.

- REMOVED support for temporary documents [see here](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3777#issuecomment-1120669088)
- REMOVED RxDatabase.broadcastChannel The broadcast channel has been moved out of the RxDatabase and is part of the RxStorage. So it is not longer exposed via `RxDatabase.broadcastChannel`.

- In the RxDB internal `_meta.lwt` field, we now use 2 decimals number of the unix timestamp in milliseconds.

- REMOVE RxStorageStatics `.hash` and `.hashKey`

- CHANGE removed default usage of `md5` as default hashing. Use a faster non-cryptographic hash instead.
  - ADD option to pass a custom hash function when calling `createRxDatabase`.

- Removed the `liveInterval` option of the replication. It was an edge case feature with wrong defaults. If you want to run the pull replication on internval, you can send a `RESYNC` event manually in a loop.

- CHANGE use `Float` instead of `Int` to represent timestamps in GraphQL.

- REPLACED `RxReplicationPullError` and `RxReplicationPushError` with normal `RxError` like in the rest of the RxDB code.
- REMOVED the option to filter out replication documents with the push/pull modifiers [#2552](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/issues/2552) because this does not work with the new replication protocol.
- CHANGE default of replication `live` to be set to `true`. Because most people want to do a live replication, not a one time replication.

- CHANGED Attachment data is now always handled as `Blob` because Node.js does support `Blob` since version 18.0.0 so we no longer have to use a `Buffer` but instead can use Blob for browsers and Node.js
- FIXED multiple problems with encoding attachments data. We now use the `js-base64` library which properly handles utf-8/binary/ascii transformations.

- RENAMED the `server` plugin is now called `server-couchdb` and `RxDatabase.server()` is now `RxDatabase.serverCouchDB()`
- ADDED the [websocket replication plugin](./docs-src/replication-websocket.md)
- ADDED the [FoundationDB RxStorage](./docs-src/rx-storage-foundationdb.md)

- FIX `couchdb-server` plugin missed out events from the replication.

- ADD Support JsonSchema for nested additionalProperties [#3952](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3952) Thanks [@swnf](https://github.com/swnf)

- All indexes that do not contain the primaryKey, get the primary key added.
- You can now set a custom index when doing a query.
- Unified the replication primitives and the GraphQL replication plugin.
- Removed the deprecated in-memory plugin.
- Added cleanup plugin
- Refactor local documents plugin to only create a storage instance for local documents when needed.
- Removed the `core` plugin. The default export `from 'rxdb'` now exports only the RxDB core without plugins.

- The Dexie.js RxStorage is no longer in beta mode.
- Added the in memory storage plugin.
- Added `RxDocument().toMutableJSON()`
- Added `RxCollection().bulkUpsert()`
- Added optional `init()` function to `RxPlugin`.

- Refactored the usage of RxCollection.storageInstance to ensure all hooks run properly.
- Refactored the encryption plugin so no more plugin specific code is in the RxDB core.
- Removed the encrypted export from the json-import-export plugin. This was barely used and made everything more complex. All exports are no non-encrypted. If you need them encrypted, you can still run by encryption after the export is done.

- Attachments are now internally handled as string instead of `Blob` or `Buffer`
- Fix (replication primitives) only drop pulled documents when a relevant document was changed locally.
- Fix dexie.js was not able to query over an index when `keyCompression: true`

Changes to `RxStorageInterface`:
- `RxStorageInstance` must have the `RxStorage` in the `storage` property.
- The `_deleted` field is now required for each data interaction with `RxStorage`.
- Removed `RxStorageInstance.getChangedDocuments()` and added `RxStorageInstance.getChangedDocumentsSince()` for better performance.
- Added `doesBroadcastChangestream()` to `RxStorageStatics`
- Added `withDeleted` parameter to `RxStorageKeyObjectInstance.findLocalDocumentsById()`
- Added internal `_meta` property to stored document data that contains internal document related data like last-write-time and replication checkpoints.

### 11.0.0 (3 January 2022) BREAKING [read the announcement](./orga/releases/11.0.0.md)

BREAKING:
  - RxStorage: The non async functions `prepareQuery`, `getSortComparator` and `getQueryMatcher` have been moved out of `RxStorageInstance` into `RxStorage`. This was needed to have better WebWorker support. This will not affect you do not use a custom `RxStorage` implementation.
  - LokiJS: Do not use the `IdleQueue` of the RxDatabase to handle calls to saveDatabase(), instead wait for CPU idleness of the JavaScript process.
  - `RxStorageInterface`:
    - Replaced all `Map` with plain json objects so that they can be `JSON.stringify`-ed
    - Replaced typings of event stream to use `EventBulk` and process events in bulks to save performance.
    - Move all static methods into the `statics` property so we can code-split when using the worker plugin.

    - Added the statics `hashKey` property to identify the used hash function.
  - Internally all events are handles via bulks, this saves performance when events are transfered over a WebWorker or a BroadcastChannel.
  - Removed the deprecated `recieved` methods, use `received` instead. [See #3392](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3392)
  - Removed the `no-validate` plugin. To use RxDB without schema validation, just do not add a validation plugin to your custom build.

Bugfixes:
  - Do not throw an error when database is destroyed while a GraphQL replication is running.
  - Compound primary key migration throws "Value of primary key(s) cannot be changed" [#3546](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3546) Thanks [@nothingkid](https://github.com/nothingkid)
  - Allow `_id` as primaryKey [#3562](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/pull/3562) Thanks [@SuperKirik](https://github.com/SuperKirik)
  - LokiJS: Remote operations do never resolve when remote instance was leader and died.

Other:
  - LokiJS: All documents are stored with a `$lastWriteAt` field, so we can implement an auto compaction later.
  - Transpile `async`/`await` to promises instead of generators. via [babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises](https://github.com/rpetrich/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-promises)
