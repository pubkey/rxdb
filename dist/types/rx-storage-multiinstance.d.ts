/**
 * When a persistend RxStorage is used in more the one JavaScript process,
 * the even stream of the changestream() function must be broadcasted to the other
 * RxStorageInstances of the same databaseName+collectionName.
 *
 * In the past this was done by RxDB but it makes more sense to do this
 * at the RxStorage level so that the broadcasting etc can all happen inside of a WebWorker
 * and not on the main thread.
 * Also it makes it less complex to stack up different RxStorages onto each other
 * like what we do with the in-memory plugin.
 *
 * This is intened to be used inside of createStorageInstance() of a storage.
 * Do not use this if the storage anyway broadcasts the events like when using MongoDB
 * or in the future W3C might introduce a way to listen to IndexedDB changes.
