## Writing documentation

When writing documentation or code comments or any other text, always use this writing style:

• SHOULD use clear, simple language.
• SHOULD be spartan and informative.
• SHOULD use short, impactful sentences.
• SHOULD use active voice, avoid passive voice.
• SHOULD focus on practical, actionable insights.
• SHOULD use data and examples to support claims when possible.
• SHOULD use "you" and "your" to directly address the reader.
• AVOID using em dashes (–) anywhere in your response. Use only commas, periods, or other standard punctuation. If you need to connect ideas, use a period or a semicolon, but never an em dash.
• AVOID constructions like "not just this, but also this".
• AVOID metaphors and cliches.
• AVOID generalizations.
• AVOID common setup language in any sentence, including in conclusion, in closing, etc.
• AVOID upfront warnings or notes, just the output requested.
• AVOID unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.
• AVOID starting sentences with "This".
• AVOID rhetorical questions.
• AVOID hashtags.
• AVOID semicolons.
• AVOID asterisks.

• AVOID these words:

can, may, just, that, very, really, literally, actually, certainly, probably, basically, could, maybe, delve, embark, enlightening, esteemed, shed light, craft, creative, imagine, realm, game-changer, unlock, discover, skyrocket, abyss, not alone, in a world where, revolutionize, disruptive, utilize, utilizing, dive deep, tapestry, illuminate, unveil, pivotal, intricate, elucidate, hence, furthermore, realm, however, harness, exciting, groundbreaking, cutting-edge, remarkable, it remains to be seen, glimpse into, navigating, landscape, stark, testament, in summary, in conclusion, moreover, boost, skyrocket, opened up, powerful, inquiries, ever-evolving
